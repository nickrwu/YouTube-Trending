Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually  poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan...It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders  to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse.What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?OUR CHANNELS▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀German Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDESpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeESHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀This is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!Get Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  Join the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  DISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀Reddit:            https://kgs.link/redditInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagramTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitterFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebookDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discordNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletterOUR VOICE▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀The Kurzgesagt voice is from Steve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voiceOUR MUSIC ♬♪▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:Spotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotifySoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloudBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcampYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtubeFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebookThe Soundtrack of this video:Soundcloud:   https://bit.ly/3jmaA12Bandcamp:     https://bit.ly/3mhAKE3 🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀Many Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:Ulgry MadHats, AleMez, lady-shroom, Marek Matas, Mitzy Sosa, Mattia Failla, Eugen Lounkine, Frankie Eder, Denis, Brian Wilson, Logan Allen, Martin Mägar, Bence Szebenyi, Jacob Michael, Maddy Berry, Sergey Voronov, Spiccy Panda, Domino Puttick, Morten Kahn, David, pascalfire, Dallas, Bruno Poli, Milka3105, Jonathan King, Matthew Jones, Giacomo Costanzi, Andre M, Thomas Fitchette, Jacob Ashton, Ryouran, Alexander Hansen, Omri Klag, Isak Ellmer, Shadmere, Rachel Smith, Eric Hegi, novatril, Ilya Kustov, Varsha Vidushi, Josef Vondrák, Taus Ahmed, Nicholas Smith, Apokalypsor, Max Strieder, Tim Tufts, Michelle S, David Bowman, Maxell Richardson, Jane Valley, StukaJi86, Max, Umar Kabz, Jonathan Krailler, Illia Tulupov, Kyle Begovich, Christopher B Kaehny, Tatiana Jiménez, Jon Tiburzi, ivo galic, Cole Stewart-Johnson, Ryan Everts, Alexia Colon, MightyGremlin, JT Schley, Eric Thorne, Farid Nader Nejad, mahan gopalan, Louisa O'Brien, Matija Potocnik, Margrethe N.

However, the official video of the run poses many questions that introduce an element of doubt, so let's investigate and determine if everything is what it seems...SSC report that on 10th October, 2020, the Tuatara in production specification form broke a top speed record with one direction at 331.15mph and the other at 301.07mph for an average of 316.1mph - beating the previous record of the Koenigsegg Agera RS by 38.2mph (from 277.9mph). The runs took place on the very same road, the Nevada Highway 160 from the intersection with Tecopa Road with the Tuatara's fastest direction heading South-East towards Las Vegas and the slow speed on the return.After plenty of time spent viewing the videos and analysing the data presented from the run so far, let's calculate whether it's possible and investigate further into these numbers. There are a number of areas that don't quite add up; from the time travelling between the fixed medians on the road and the painted street markings, to the dashboard and telemetry data being out of sync, and also on the technical side with the engine and gearbox configuration.A further topic of discussion not mentioned is the noticeable lag between the shift points recorded by the telemetry data which can simply be seen coming a few seconds delayed in comparison to the visual cues of the shift and rev counter, plus the audible sound of the RPMs.This video asks questions, based on the information given so far. If there are answers, it would be fantastic to hear them and the accompanying data that lines up to prove that the record has indeed been broken.Thanks to Jey, Matt, Kaare, Robert, Misha and many more for their involvement.FACTUAL CORRECTION: The rear tyre setup is 345, not 335 which produces a maximum 6th gear speed of 477.67 km/h - 296.15 mph, 3mph faster than suggested.Information and data sources:BBC Top Gear 331mph Record video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N22JfNHiC1kSSC Tuatara vs Koenigsegg Agera RS head to head video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLoFKcH7zGoStart location for the run:https://goo.gl/maps/6ZzK3ZCppWJZqoxL6Oli Webb confirming 6th gear for the run:https://youtu.be/bkUuX5TLVes?t=204Comparative Data:Koenigsegg Agera RS 271.19mph in 5th Oct 2017Average run speed of 277.9mphSlower run SE, faster run NW of 284.55mphSSC Tuatara 331.15mph on 10th Oct 2020 Average run speed of 316.1mphFaster run SE, slower run NW of 301.07mphMedian Comparisons:Start to 1st medianDistance: 1.69km / 1.05mTime: 38.18s = 99.5mph avg1st to 2nd medianDistance: 1.81km / 1.13mTime: 22.64s = 179.7mph avgEntry at 192mph, exit at 307mph2nd to 3rd medianDistance: 2.28km / 1.42mTime: 28.24s including a pausePause is 3:82Total time: 24.40s = 209.5mph avgEntry at 307mph, exit at 242mph1st to 3rdTotal excluding the pause is 47.39s = 195mphEntry at 194mph, exit at 242mph, 331mph along the wayThanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150","21M15S"

In the new series, when California governor Zack Morris gets into hot water for closing too many underfunded high schools, he proposes they send the affected students to the most well-funded schools in the state – including Bayside High. The influx of new students gives the privileged Bayside kids (who never have a problem that can't be solved in twenty-two minutes) a much-needed dose of reality. Elizabeth Berkley Lauren and Mario Lopez star in the new SAVED BY THE BELL series, reprising their roles as Jessie Spano and A.C. Slater. John Michael Higgins also stars as Principal Toddman alongside the new class featuring Belmont Cameli, Dexter Darden, Mitchell Hoog, Alycia Pascual-Peña, Josie Totah and Haskiri Velazquez. Tracey Wigfield serves as writer and executive producer for the series, alongside executive producer Franco Bario. Peter Engel also serves as executive producer. SAVED BY THE BELL is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group.","2M9S"

A lot of people seem to think you can’t, (or you shouldn’t) because how you should train to get strong is supposedly very different from how you should train to get big. But I don’t quite agree with this. It’s common to hear that if you want to get strong, you need to lift heavy weights for low reps and if you want to get big, you need to lift light to moderate weights for relatively higher reps. Most personal trainers and textbooks outline clear and distinct rep zones for strength, hypertrophy and endurance. For strength: you lift heavy, for size: you lift moderate and for endurance: you lift light. And while there is some truth to this, it doesn’t capture the full picture.The bottom line is: unless you’re going really, ridiculously light, heavy weights (low reps) AND light weights (high reps) are BOTH effective at building muscle. However, when it comes to strength, the rep range really does seem to matter: it is important to lift heavy to maximize top-end strength development. In this video I will describe periodization and progression examples for powerbuilding (powerliftng plus bodybuilding) based on these principles.-------------------------------Sources:MASS Volume 2, Issue 5 (http://bit.ly/jeffMASS)https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564973/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24714538/https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/http://www.kylehuntfitness.com/in-defense-of-powerlifting-why-its-not-hurting-bodybuilding/Video was filmed at Florida Extreme Fitness Center in Jacksonville, Fl!

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.","9M38S"

Naughty Nude means so much to me & on so many levels. It’s more than just a palette… it’s personal sh*t!! It represents no more sexual shame and feeling liberated with my mind and body, and finally accepting and loving myself! Now, I can finally embrace who am; I feel powerful and free in ways I’ve never felt before and I hope you feel that power too, with the palette, or with makeup (or whatever) sets you free.

It was left in a barn near Hershey Pennsylvania before its first wash in 44 years! You'd expect this to be a complete detailing disaster because it was left untouched for so long...but the paint was in good condition despite being covered in filth and disgusting grime. In this barn find, we use AMMO Frothe to remove the first layer of dust and dirt to ensure the rubber seals did not leak if we power washed. Once confident, we power washed the paint, then compounded and polished with a Rupes polisher during our paint restoration. The Datsun 280z has since won several awards at Zcon and more information can be found at www.350mile280z.com.ADD DETAILING SIMULATOR TO WISH LIST HERE:https://store.steampowered.com/app/1433570/Car_Detailing_Simulator/AMMO Paint Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-paint-regimen-kit/AMMO Interior Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-interiorregimen-kit/AMMO Wheel Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-wheel-regimen-kit/For more how to car care videos & full product line: http://www.ammonyc.com Carpet Brush for hand drill: https://amzn.to/31F2PKLRapid Adhesive Remover: https://amzn.to/2WcuOjNMini Shampooer: https://amzn.to/2W7swlTHeadliner Adhesive: https://amzn.to/33Ts9OxWindow Squeegee: https://amzn.to/2BAcE1XInduction Heater: https://amzn.to/2N4YUBFFestool Vacuum: https://amzn.to/33PuKJkSteam Machine: https://www.ammonyc.com/shop/steam-machine/If you’re a car fanatic like me, click the link below to be notified of my latest AMMO videos, products, podcasts, website promo’s and to take our quick Detailing Survey!http://eepurl.com/dOZ6ybAMMO Formulas used in this video: https://www.ammonyc.com/Recommended products and tools approved by AMMO NYC: Megs D300 https://amzn.to/2BUnXSQFoam Applicator Pads https://amzn.to/2MVU7U6Foam Gun https://amzn.to/2PEgNubWheel Woolies https://amzn.to/32YhGBxTar Remover https://amzn.to/2pYK6gaTire Gel Applicator https://amzn.to/2MVcf0oFestool Vacuum https://amzn.to/31Vv6wNMilwaukee Fan https://amzn.to/2peO9VEMilwaukee Rapid Charge https://amzn.to/2Wp2UB7Festool Vacuum Crevice https://amzn.to/34benXDRupes Polisher 21 https://amzn.to/2NisKCQRupes Polisher 3-in. https://amzn.to/2Wnl9HjMegs Foam Polishing Disc 6 https://amzn.to/2PqILJDMegs Foam Cutting Disc 6 https://amzn.to/2MXPbOTRupes Bag https://amzn.to/2PulLcwPositector Paint Depth Gauge https://amzn.to/2JwqOpfMercury Spray Bottle https://amzn.to/2PrFRnNMasterblaster https://amzn.to/2C4Rt8FCR Spotless Water Filter https://amzn.to/31Y7DuWMegs MF finish 3 https://amzn.to/2N04UgpMegs MF finish 5 https://amzn.to/2Pulq9LMegs MF finish 6 https://amzn.to/2q1TO19Megs MF cutting 3 https://amzn.to/2BTDSAYMegs MF cutting 5 https://amzn.to/2Nju1tkMegs MF cutting 6 https://amzn.to/2q1TX4HBlack Wow https://amzn.to/2PtG4XHMegs M205 https://amzn.to/2JwrNprMegs M105 https://amzn.to/2Ps31dSRoboReel https://amzn.to/2Pud6qPSteam Machine VX5000 https://amzn.to/368WBGmElcometer Paint Depth https://amzn.to/2NkP52AScangrip I-view https://amzn.to/2BWIN3KScangrip D-Match 2 https://amzn.to/2q1VU1bGorilla Gloves https://amzn.to/36k2ZLgLong-handled Window Scrubber https://amzn.to/2JyxZgJLoew-Cornell Fine line painting pen https://amzn.to/2JMhPAzFight Tech Dust Mask https://amzn.to/34bPZVRCarpet Brushes https://amzn.to/2qQiWIxSubscribe to AMMO NYC for clean cars: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=AMMONYCdotcomFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AMMOnyc/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ammonyc/For more product info: http://www.ammonyc.com/AMMO NYC Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/user/AMMONYCdotcomIf this video was helpful, please give us a THUMBS UP!Disclaimer:Due to factors beyond the control of AMMO NYC, Larry Kosilla, and Make Rain Productions, we cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

Our group has to figure out who on the ship are murderers, while making sure they are doing their tasks so that their spaceship doesn't continue its forward frontflipping momentum.

Should it be?It’s easy to complain about overreliance on special effects, but for projects that require impossible-to-film environments or have incredibly expensive shots, how do you get the flexibility of green screens without the drawbacks?Charmaine Chan has worked on one of the possible answers. Vox's Phil Edwards spoke to her about her career and how it's at the forefront of a big technological shift. As a compositor for venerable effects house Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), she’s worked on films like The Last Jedi, assembling various digital elements into a beautiful, seamless image. Her job changed on The Mandalorian, one of the first shows to use ILM’s upgrade for the green screen: LED panels that used video game engine technology to place a realistic-looking world behind the actors.It was a huge improvement, because green screens actually have a lot of drawbacks. Removing the green screen is never as quick as visual effects artists would hope. It also casts green light upon the set and actors. Even substitutes for a green screen, like projecting an image onto a screen behind the actor, fail to dynamically respond to camera movements the way they would in the real world.ILM’s solution fixes a lot of those problems, and it also led to creative breakthroughs in which the old Hollywood order of a TV show or movie, in which VFX came last, was suddenly reversed. Now, artists like Charmaine are alongside actors, set designers, and other crew members during filming. That collaboration means that this technology doesn’t just eliminate a screen — it eliminates a creative barrier.Watch the above video to see how it happens.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

And no, we're not talking about Mat or Yianni! Our drag race supremo, the Porsche 911 Turbo S, is back once again to defend its crown. It's previously smashed the quarter-mile in just 10.1 seconds, making it the definitive carwow drag race king. However, the latest contender may give it a run for its money... Evolve's tuned BMW M5 Competition has joined us for previous drag races, taking down a Ferrari 488 Pista and 1600hp Nissan GT-R, to name just a few. However, whereas before it had been tuned to deliver 800hp, it's now been turned up a notch to deliver an incredible 1,000hp!! We know the 911 Turbo S can deliver, but when it only produces 650hp, will that be enough to retain its crown?!

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Carter Rubin Is 14 and Delivers on Lewis Capaldi's Before You Go - The Voice Blind Auditions 2020https://youtu.be/wzG_Wx_g4AgThe Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","6M2S"
