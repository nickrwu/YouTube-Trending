Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually  poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan...It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders  to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse.What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?OUR CHANNELS‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDESpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeESHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!Get Merch designed with ‚ù§ from https://kgs.link/shop  Join the Patreon Bird Army üêß https://kgs.link/patreon  DISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄReddit:            https://kgs.link/redditInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagramTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitterFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebookDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discordNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletterOUR VOICE‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄThe Kurzgesagt voice is from Steve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voiceOUR MUSIC ‚ô¨‚ô™‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:Spotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotifySoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloudBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcampYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtubeFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebookThe Soundtrack of this video:Soundcloud:   https://bit.ly/3jmaA12Bandcamp:     https://bit.ly/3mhAKE3 üê¶üêßüê§ PATREON BIRD ARMY üê§üêßüê¶‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:Ulgry MadHats, AleMez, lady-shroom, Marek Matas, Mitzy Sosa, Mattia Failla, Eugen Lounkine, Frankie Eder, Denis, Brian Wilson, Logan Allen, Martin M√§gar, Bence Szebenyi, Jacob Michael, Maddy Berry, Sergey Voronov, Spiccy Panda, Domino Puttick, Morten Kahn, David, pascalfire, Dallas, Bruno Poli, Milka3105, Jonathan King, Matthew Jones, Giacomo Costanzi, Andre M, Thomas Fitchette, Jacob Ashton, Ryouran, Alexander Hansen, Omri Klag, Isak Ellmer, Shadmere, Rachel Smith, Eric Hegi, novatril, Ilya Kustov, Varsha Vidushi, Josef Vondr√°k, Taus Ahmed, Nicholas Smith, Apokalypsor, Max Strieder, Tim Tufts, Michelle S, David Bowman, Maxell Richardson, Jane Valley, StukaJi86, Max, Umar Kabz, Jonathan Krailler, Illia Tulupov, Kyle Begovich, Christopher B Kaehny, Tatiana Jim√©nez, Jon Tiburzi, ivo galic, Cole Stewart-Johnson, Ryan Everts, Alexia Colon, MightyGremlin, JT Schley, Eric Thorne, Farid Nader Nejad, mahan gopalan, Louisa O'Brien, Matija Potocnik, Margrethe N.

With the technological concept of the BUGATTI Bolide, we are now providing the answer. The experimental study of the BUGATTI Bolide is this track-oriented hyper sports car featuring a modified version of the iconic W16 engine with a minimal body for maximum downforce. The BUGATTI Bolide is the most extreme, uncompromising, fastest and lightest vehicle concept in our company‚Äôs recent history ‚Äì with an unprecedented weight-to-power ratio of 0.67 kg per PS. This is made possible by the combination of the W16 engine with 1,850 PS and a vehicle weight of just 1,240 kilograms. The BUGATTI Bolide achieves figures that are almost on par with Formula 1 while its top speed is well above 500 km/h ‚Äì without compromising optimum handling and maximum agility. The Bolide takes 3 .07.1 minutes to complete a lap of Le Mans and 5 .23.1 minutes to get around the Nordschleife and thus promises to offer the ultimate BUGATTI performance kick.","13M43S"

However, the official video of the run poses many questions that introduce an element of doubt, so let's investigate and determine if everything is what it seems...SSC report that on 10th October, 2020, the Tuatara in production specification form broke a top speed record with one direction at 331.15mph and the other at 301.07mph for an average of 316.1mph - beating the previous record of the Koenigsegg Agera RS by 38.2mph (from 277.9mph). The runs took place on the very same road, the Nevada Highway 160 from the intersection with Tecopa Road with the Tuatara's fastest direction heading South-East towards Las Vegas and the slow speed on the return.After plenty of time spent viewing the videos and analysing the data presented from the run so far, let's calculate whether it's possible and investigate further into these numbers. There are a number of areas that don't quite add up; from the time travelling between the fixed medians on the road and the painted street markings, to the dashboard and telemetry data being out of sync, and also on the technical side with the engine and gearbox configuration.A further topic of discussion not mentioned is the noticeable lag between the shift points recorded by the telemetry data which can simply be seen coming a few seconds delayed in comparison to the visual cues of the shift and rev counter, plus the audible sound of the RPMs.This video asks questions, based on the information given so far. If there are answers, it would be fantastic to hear them and the accompanying data that lines up to prove that the record has indeed been broken.Thanks to Jey, Matt, Kaare, Robert, Misha and many more for their involvement.FACTUAL CORRECTION: The rear tyre setup is 345, not 335 which produces a maximum 6th gear speed of 477.67 km/h - 296.15 mph, 3mph faster than suggested.Information and data sources:BBC Top Gear 331mph Record video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N22JfNHiC1kSSC Tuatara vs Koenigsegg Agera RS head to head video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLoFKcH7zGoStart location for the run:https://goo.gl/maps/6ZzK3ZCppWJZqoxL6Oli Webb confirming 6th gear for the run:https://youtu.be/bkUuX5TLVes?t=204Comparative Data:Koenigsegg Agera RS 271.19mph in 5th Oct 2017Average run speed of 277.9mphSlower run SE, faster run NW of 284.55mphSSC Tuatara 331.15mph on 10th Oct 2020 Average run speed of 316.1mphFaster run SE, slower run NW of 301.07mphMedian Comparisons:Start to 1st medianDistance: 1.69km / 1.05mTime: 38.18s = 99.5mph avg1st to 2nd medianDistance: 1.81km / 1.13mTime: 22.64s = 179.7mph avgEntry at 192mph, exit at 307mph2nd to 3rd medianDistance: 2.28km / 1.42mTime: 28.24s including a pausePause is 3:82Total time: 24.40s = 209.5mph avgEntry at 307mph, exit at 242mph1st to 3rdTotal excluding the pause is 47.39s = 195mphEntry at 194mph, exit at 242mph, 331mph along the wayThanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150","21M15S"

In the new series, when California governor Zack Morris gets into hot water for closing too many underfunded high schools, he proposes they send the affected students to the most well-funded schools in the state ‚Äì including Bayside High. The influx of new students gives the privileged Bayside kids (who never have a problem that can't be solved in twenty-two minutes) a much-needed dose of reality. Elizabeth Berkley Lauren and Mario Lopez star in the new SAVED BY THE BELL series, reprising their roles as Jessie Spano and A.C. Slater. John Michael Higgins also stars as Principal Toddman alongside the new class featuring Belmont Cameli, Dexter Darden, Mitchell Hoog, Alycia Pascual-Pe√±a, Josie Totah and Haskiri Velazquez. Tracey Wigfield serves as writer and executive producer for the series, alongside executive producer Franco Bario. Peter Engel also serves as executive producer.

A lot of people seem to think you can‚Äôt, (or you shouldn‚Äôt) because how you should train to get strong is supposedly very different from how you should train to get big. But I don‚Äôt quite agree with this. It‚Äôs common to hear that if you want to get strong, you need to lift heavy weights for low reps and if you want to get big, you need to lift light to moderate weights for relatively higher reps. Most personal trainers and textbooks outline clear and distinct rep zones for strength, hypertrophy and endurance. For strength: you lift heavy, for size: you lift moderate and for endurance: you lift light. And while there is some truth to this, it doesn‚Äôt capture the full picture.The bottom line is: unless you‚Äôre going really, ridiculously light, heavy weights (low reps) AND light weights (high reps) are BOTH effective at building muscle. However, when it comes to strength, the rep range really does seem to matter: it is important to lift heavy to maximize top-end strength development. In this video I will describe periodization and progression examples for powerbuilding (powerliftng plus bodybuilding) based on these principles.-------------------------------Sources:MASS Volume 2, Issue 5 (http://bit.ly/jeffMASS)https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564973/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24714538/https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/http://www.kylehuntfitness.com/in-defense-of-powerlifting-why-its-not-hurting-bodybuilding/Video was filmed at Florida Extreme Fitness Center in Jacksonville, Fl!

Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù golf clubs.

It was left in a barn near Hershey Pennsylvania before its first wash in 44 years! You'd expect this to be a complete detailing disaster because it was left untouched for so long...but the paint was in good condition despite being covered in filth and disgusting grime. In this barn find, we use AMMO Frothe to remove the first layer of dust and dirt to ensure the rubber seals did not leak if we power washed. Once confident, we power washed the paint, then compounded and polished with a Rupes polisher during our paint restoration.

After lots of band-aids and medbay visits, our friends are back and better than ever, and as usual are hurling through the dark and unforgiving spacescape with nothing but their tiny brains and a maddening amount of terrible arguments. Our group has to figure out who on the ship are murderers, while making sure they are doing their tasks so that their spaceship doesn't continue its forward frontflipping momentum. Is red sus or is blue? Who should we vote out? Which player is the imposter venting to kill? Will people be murdered by the imposter or by their beloved crewmates?
