Trump then leaked the full interview himself.The interview begins with Lesley Stahl asking Donald Trump, 'You're ok with some tough questions?' and Trump responding, 'No, I'm not.' Lesley Stahl repeatedly presses President Trump to share his health care plan, to explain the rise in COVID-19 cases, to justify why he called Dr. Anthony Fauci an 'idiot,' and more.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show‚Äôs innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist‚Äôs voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Carter Rubin Is 14 and Delivers on Lewis Capaldi's Before You Go - The Voice Blind Auditions 2020https://youtu.be/wzG_Wx_g4AgThe Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","6M2S"

How do we change that?What do you wish the presidential candidates would talk about? http://vox.com/ElectionVideosIn the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country‚Äôs carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.This video is the seventh in our series on the 2020 election. We aren‚Äôt covering the horse race; instead, we want to explain the stakes of the election through the issues that matter most to you.

First off, here's a little life update; We filmed this back in September but didn't get time to edit and upload the video until now. Immediately after filming our trip to Rocky Mountain Raceweek 2.0 (which is not in the Rocky Mountains), we left town to film Roadkill and Faster With Finnegan and we still aren't done filming those shows so we are working on Finnegan's Garage edits in our spare time. Anyway, since September, a lot has happened. I've bought a new enclosed ramp truck, which you'll briefly see in this video, I've traded away the six-door Ford F650 for a '66 Chevy Suburban, which you'll also see in this video, too. We also had a small shift linkage issue in Blasphemi during Rocky Mountain Raceweek 2.0, which resulted in a major engine failure-again, it's in this video. With any luck we'll upload Part 2 of the video next week. In that video, you'll see the rest of the road trip and you get to see my wife cry when I surprise her on our 15th wedding anniversary. :)03:37 If you'd like to grab the cool LED lights from WireCare.com we used on our trailer in this episode then go here: https://www.wirecare.com/interest/audio-visual/led/led-lighting-kits/as-rgb5mk2-5m-kit-rgb-5050-led-strip-44kyCheck out Rugged Radios which we would have used way more if not for the small engine failure!:https://www.ruggedradios.comIf you'd like your own Finnegan Speed and Marine shirt, hats or stickers then go here: www.fsmgarage.comAll proceeds will go toward fixing the damn Hemi-again! lolthanks!-Finnegan","31M52S"

Despite being down players they created opportunities and gave Zinedine Zidane and his Real Madrid squad problems from start to finish.  Shakhtar came out with a strong offensive plan and put the pressure on Real Madrid early and often. The early offensive pressure resulted in a goal in the 29‚Äô by Tet√™ thrusting the Ukranian side to an early 1-0 lead. Not long after the goal, Tet√™ was causing problems again. He took a shot from the top of the box causing Real Madrid‚Äôs keeper, Thibaut Courtois, to deflect the ball back into play, but it went off of his own defender, Rapha√´l Varane, for an own goal giving Shakhtar a commanding 2-0 lead in the 33‚Äô. Tet√™ wasn‚Äôt done leaving his mark on the first half though, in the 42‚Äô he played a beautiful back heel pass to an open Manor Solomon who drilled it to the bottom left corner of the goal to bolster Shakhtar‚Äôs lead over Real Madrid, 3-0. Real Madrid started the second half playing with more fire, and they got things going with an absolute banger of a goal in the 54‚Äô by Luka Modriƒá from 30 meters. Real Madrid kept the pressure on by scoring its second goal just 5 minutes later in the 59‚Äô by Vin√≠cius J√∫nior who had just come on to the pitch after being on the bench for the first half. Real Madrid had one final opportunity late in the second half to pull even, but Vin√≠cius J√∫nior was ruled offside via VAR and the goal was called off.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show‚Äôs innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist‚Äôs voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Ryan Gallagher Shines on Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion's The Prayer - Voice Blind Auditions 2020https://youtu.be/dY3PpXOH520The Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","6M6S"

The spacecraft must target Bennu‚Äôs rocky surface with great accuracy, touching down within a rocky area just 52 ft (16 m) in diameter. During the maneuver, the spacecraft and the asteroid will be approximately 207 million miles (334 million km) from Earth.Live coverage from Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, Colorado, with mission managers from the University of Arizona, Lockheed Martin, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center begins at 5 p.m. EDT.¬†The spacecraft is scheduled to depart Bennu in 2021, and to deliver the collected sample to Earth on Sep. 24, 2023. It will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth, and the largest sample returned from space since the Apollo era.","1H28M43S"

I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.Stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è see you next video.üëï merch:https://crowdmade.com/collections/icecreamsandwichüì± twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuyüì∑ instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.
