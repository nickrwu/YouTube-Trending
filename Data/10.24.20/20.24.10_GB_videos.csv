And no, we're not talking about Mat or Yianni! Our drag race supremo, the Porsche 911 Turbo S, is back once again to defend its crown. It's previously smashed the quarter-mile in just 10.1 seconds, making it the definitive carwow drag race king. However, the latest contender may give it a run for its money... Evolve's tuned BMW M5 Competition has joined us for previous drag races, taking down a Ferrari 488 Pista and 1600hp Nissan GT-R, to name just a few. However, whereas before it had been tuned to deliver 800hp, it's now been turned up a notch to deliver an incredible 1,000hp!! We know the 911 Turbo S can deliver, but when it only produces 650hp, will that be enough to retain its crown?!

Should it be?It‚Äôs easy to complain about overreliance on special effects, but for projects that require impossible-to-film environments or have incredibly expensive shots, how do you get the flexibility of green screens without the drawbacks?Charmaine Chan has worked on one of the possible answers. Vox's Phil Edwards spoke to her about her career and how it's at the forefront of a big technological shift. As a compositor for venerable effects house Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), she‚Äôs worked on films like The Last Jedi, assembling various digital elements into a beautiful, seamless image. Her job changed on The Mandalorian, one of the first shows to use ILM‚Äôs upgrade for the green screen: LED panels that used video game engine technology to place a realistic-looking world behind the actors.It was a huge improvement, because green screens actually have a lot of drawbacks. Removing the green screen is never as quick as visual effects artists would hope. It also casts green light upon the set and actors. Even substitutes for a green screen, like projecting an image onto a screen behind the actor, fail to dynamically respond to camera movements the way they would in the real world.ILM‚Äôs solution fixes a lot of those problems, and it also led to creative breakthroughs in which the old Hollywood order of a TV show or movie, in which VFX came last, was suddenly reversed. Now, artists like Charmaine are alongside actors, set designers, and other crew members during filming. That collaboration means that this technology doesn‚Äôt just eliminate a screen ‚Äî it eliminates a creative barrier.Watch the above video to see how it happens.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

How do we change that?What do you wish the presidential candidates would talk about? http://vox.com/ElectionVideosIn the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country‚Äôs carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.This video is the seventh in our series on the 2020 election. We aren‚Äôt covering the horse race; instead, we want to explain the stakes of the election through the issues that matter most to you.

Tune in to our live broadcast as our spacecraft descends to the surface of asteroid Bennu, touches down for a few seconds & attempts to capture regolith (rocks and dust) using a ‚ÄúTouch-And-Go,‚Äù or TAG, maneuver. The spacecraft must target Bennu‚Äôs rocky surface with great accuracy, touching down within a rocky area just 52 ft (16 m) in diameter. During the maneuver, the spacecraft and the asteroid will be approximately 207 million miles (334 million km) from Earth.Live coverage from Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, Colorado, with mission managers from the University of Arizona, Lockheed Martin, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center begins at 5 p.m. EDT.¬†The spacecraft is scheduled to depart Bennu in 2021, and to deliver the collected sample to Earth on Sep. 24, 2023. It will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth, and the largest sample returned from space since the Apollo era.","1H28M43S"

Since the release of infectious rap anthem ‚ÄòFrontline‚Äô via Mixtape Madness, the 22-year-old from Coventry has established himself as a leading light within Britain‚Äôs flourishing rap landscape. Armed with a distinct, melodic cadence that incorporates influences from his Gambian heritage, Salieu has forged his identity into a unique brand of rap that is quickly drawing attention and applause from wide quarters. The early momentum of ‚ÄòFrontline‚Äô has continued with a string of feature verses over the last few months. He connected with South London‚Äôs SL for ‚ÄòHit the Block,‚Äô as well as Meekz, M1llionz and Teeway on ‚ÄòYear of the Real.‚Äô He also joined Backroad Gee and Ambush for the remix to street heater ‚ÄòParty Popper‚Äô on GRM Daily. The next stage in his journey sees him release the tracks ‚ÄòBang Out‚Äô and ‚ÄòBetty‚Äô, prior to an upcoming mixtape. #PaSalieu #Black","1M55S"

I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.Stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è see you next video.üëï merch:https://crowdmade.com/collections/icecreamsandwichüì± twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuyüì∑ instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

We've got an F81 M3 Touring going head-to-head with the new BMW M340i xDrive Touring! Now we know what you BMW fanboys will be saying - BMW never made an F81 M3 Touring. And you're right, they didn't... So what you're seeing here is a custom-built, one-of-a-kind exclusive. The owner took a BMW 320d, and then took all the parts from an M3 F80 and built THIS! Not only that, but the engine's also been tuned, so the 3-litre straight-six turbo now delivers 540hp & 680Nm! Now it may have more power than the M340i, which can 'only' produce 374hp & 500Nm of torque, but it does have one advantage - it's got all-wheel drive, whereas the M3 only has rear-wheel drive! Will it be enough to power the 'M3 Lite' to victory?

On this occasion, they will hold a Moonlight festival at [12:00], when the moon shines the brightest‚Äîa festival where no girl will feel silenced.LOOŒ†Œî makes coincidence when destiny collides with fate, and finds her destiny within coincidence and fate to deliver a new message for the Midnight Festival.  ‚ÄòWith all LOOŒ†Œîs around the world‚Äô, all of the LOOŒ†Œîs across the globe will always be together, where all are dignified, equal and worthy of freedom. The united voices of the girls around the world rings loud and clear ahead of the start of the new moon. Intro for the album which is ‚Äô12:00‚Äô, it is promised time in the new space, capturing our story of getting into orbit.The titled track ‚ÄòWhy Not?‚Äô is an uptempo electronic pop song, with a story of pursuing freedom and individualistic self. The funky and bubbly bass line reminiscent of the Midnight Festival is impressive. The key change in the song, which started with a charismatic introduction, from the chorus to the witty major, it resembles LOOŒ†Œî who is about to change. ‚ÄòVoice‚Äô is an energetic retro song with a low, repetitive beat that evokes addiction. It is meant to enjoy the feelings of love and to venture together in an uncontrollable excitement. ‚ÄòFall Again‚Äô has a story about falling back in love with the one every time fall returns. It is a Pop R&B, a harmonious blend of sentimental vocals and rhythmic instruments by LOOŒ†Œî. It gives the feeling of the seasonality of autumn abundant.  ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô is a dreamy up-tempo electronic pop ballad with soft sweltering pads, ambient vocals and steady beat, adding warmth to the beat of love, attraction and temptation with the piano melody, allowing you to feel the song in its entirety.  ‚ÄòHide & Seek‚Äô is a cool, bright, poptastic uptempo dance song, which it coolly reveals one‚Äôs mind that is not hidden. It is showing confidence to the opponent, like playing hide & seek.  ‚ÄòOOPS!‚Äô is a multi-groove pop song characterized by a cool, repetitive feeling and Latin undertones. It sends a message that the one will love oneself and live freely without caring about others anymore. In addition, ‚ÄòStar‚Äô which is an English version of Voice, it is aimed at global fans, will be released at the same time, allowing them to enjoy various music sources.LOOŒ†Œîs [12:00] album ‚Äî where LOOŒ†Œî creates the inevitable through the merging of coincidence and fate.#Ïù¥Îã¨ÏùòÏÜåÎÖÄ #LOONA #Midnight #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreativeMore about LOOŒ†Œî/LOOŒ†Œî Official : http://www.loonatheworld.comLOOŒ†Œî Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/LOOŒ†Œî Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworldLOOŒ†Œî Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/LOOŒ†Œî Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworldCopyrights 2020 ‚ìí BlockBerryCreative.

If you don't have any weights home - don't worry! I got you ‚ô•Ô∏é / Werbung I use a 10kg / 22 lbs dumbbell. Choose a weight that feels good for you! Weights help us to increase the intensity of a workout, build rounder muscles (booty alarm) and make us stronger! Your home-made weight: 1. Take a bag 2. Search for dense + heavy food in your kitchen. For example: packs of flour, rice, oats, etc. 3. You can easily put 6 to 10 packs into one bag. That makes 6 to 10 kg :) This workout is structured like this: - a Booty Activation, without equipment  - 6 Supersets, including 1-2 weighted exercise(s) and a bodyweight burner - a Burnout with 6min of Glute Bridges, to make those butt cheeks buuuuurnThings to keep in mind: ‚ñ∏ bodyweight focusses on your HEELS, don't shift your bodyweight onto your toes‚ñ∏ your BACK stays STRAIGHT. Don't round it! ‚ñ∏ keep your KNEES stable. Never collapse them inwards, rather push them a bit outwards ‚ñ∏ squeeze your BOOTY as hard as possible and hold the tension as long as possible, if you have troubles with only growing your thighs. The routine includes breaks! Yes, that's correct.

The previous explosive bat was cool, but it wasn't setting any records. I set out to design a bat that could beat Babe Ruth's home run record of 575 feet. The engineering was intense but the results are spectacular. Aside from attempts on the record, you can also look forward to some awesome high speed footage of the bat in action and a special guest.This video could not have been made without the help of Destin from Smarter Every Day. Not only did he provide the high speed camera, he also shared all his footage from testing the bat. He made a more in depth video on what happens when this this bat goes boom. Check it out!
