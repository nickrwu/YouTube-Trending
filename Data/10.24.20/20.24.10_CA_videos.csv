Should it be?It’s easy to complain about overreliance on special effects, but for projects that require impossible-to-film environments or have incredibly expensive shots, how do you get the flexibility of green screens without the drawbacks?Charmaine Chan has worked on one of the possible answers. Vox's Phil Edwards spoke to her about her career and how it's at the forefront of a big technological shift. As a compositor for venerable effects house Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), she’s worked on films like The Last Jedi, assembling various digital elements into a beautiful, seamless image. Her job changed on The Mandalorian, one of the first shows to use ILM’s upgrade for the green screen: LED panels that used video game engine technology to place a realistic-looking world behind the actors.It was a huge improvement, because green screens actually have a lot of drawbacks. Removing the green screen is never as quick as visual effects artists would hope. It also casts green light upon the set and actors. Even substitutes for a green screen, like projecting an image onto a screen behind the actor, fail to dynamically respond to camera movements the way they would in the real world.ILM’s solution fixes a lot of those problems, and it also led to creative breakthroughs in which the old Hollywood order of a TV show or movie, in which VFX came last, was suddenly reversed. Now, artists like Charmaine are alongside actors, set designers, and other crew members during filming. That collaboration means that this technology doesn’t just eliminate a screen — it eliminates a creative barrier.Watch the above video to see how it happens.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Carter Rubin Is 14 and Delivers on Lewis Capaldi's Before You Go - The Voice Blind Auditions 2020https://youtu.be/wzG_Wx_g4AgThe Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","6M2S"

Find the last dragon. Watch the new trailer for Raya and the Last Dragon, in theaters March 2021.Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week.

She solved puzzles, uncovered a cult,  constructed an ancient, glowing dagger, and defeated a summoned cosmic horror with it... all in the name of love.","2M28S"

Cassidy is completing his third spaceflight for a total of 378 days in space, the fifth highest total among U.S. astronauts. Ivanishin is completing his third flight into space, totaling 476 days. This was Vagner’s first spaceflight. During their expedition, Cassidy, Ivanishin, and Vagner welcomed the arrival of NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley on NASA’s SpaceX Demo-2 mission, the first crewed flight of a commercial spacecraft and the first launch of humans from American soil to the space station since 2011.","1H56M56S"

First off, here's a little life update; We filmed this back in September but didn't get time to edit and upload the video until now. Immediately after filming our trip to Rocky Mountain Raceweek 2.0 (which is not in the Rocky Mountains), we left town to film Roadkill and Faster With Finnegan and we still aren't done filming those shows so we are working on Finnegan's Garage edits in our spare time. Anyway, since September, a lot has happened. I've bought a new enclosed ramp truck, which you'll briefly see in this video, I've traded away the six-door Ford F650 for a '66 Chevy Suburban, which you'll also see in this video, too. We also had a small shift linkage issue in Blasphemi during Rocky Mountain Raceweek 2.0, which resulted in a major engine failure-again, it's in this video. With any luck we'll upload Part 2 of the video next week. In that video, you'll see the rest of the road trip and you get to see my wife cry when I surprise her on our 15th wedding anniversary. :)03:37 If you'd like to grab the cool LED lights from WireCare.com we used on our trailer in this episode then go here: https://www.wirecare.com/interest/audio-visual/led/led-lighting-kits/as-rgb5mk2-5m-kit-rgb-5050-led-strip-44kyCheck out Rugged Radios which we would have used way more if not for the small engine failure!:https://www.ruggedradios.comIf you'd like your own Finnegan Speed and Marine shirt, hats or stickers then go here: www.fsmgarage.comAll proceeds will go toward fixing the damn Hemi-again! lolthanks!-Finnegan","31M52S"

I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.Stay safe ❤️ see you next video.👕 merch:https://crowdmade.com/collections/icecreamsandwich📱 twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy📷 instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

Time to journey #ToBennuAndBack. Tune in to our live broadcast as our spacecraft descends to the surface of asteroid Bennu, touches down for a few seconds & attempts to capture regolith (rocks and dust) using a “Touch-And-Go,” or TAG, maneuver. The spacecraft must target Bennu’s rocky surface with great accuracy, touching down within a rocky area just 52 ft (16 m) in diameter. During the maneuver, the spacecraft and the asteroid will be approximately 207 million miles (334 million km) from Earth.Live coverage from Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, Colorado, with mission managers from the University of Arizona, Lockheed Martin, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center begins at 5 p.m. EDT. The spacecraft is scheduled to depart Bennu in 2021, and to deliver the collected sample to Earth on Sep. 24, 2023. It will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth, and the largest sample returned from space since the Apollo era.","1H28M43S"

It conveys powerful support and comfort to the youth with limitless potentials.#SEVENTEEN #세븐틴#Semicolon #세미콜론#HOME_RUNSEVENTEEN Official Homepage : http://www.seventeen-17.comSEVENTEEN Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/seventeennewsSEVENTEEN Official Twitter : https://twitter.com/pledis_17SEVENTEEN Official Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/saythename_17SEVENTEEN Official Fancafe : http://cafe.daum.net/pledis-17SEVENTEEN Official Weverse : https://www.weverse.io/seventeenⓒ Pledis Entertainment.

On this occasion, they will hold a Moonlight festival at [12:00], when the moon shines the brightest—a festival where no girl will feel silenced.LOOΠΔ makes coincidence when destiny collides with fate, and finds her destiny within coincidence and fate to deliver a new message for the Midnight Festival.  ‘With all LOOΠΔs around the world’, all of the LOOΠΔs across the globe will always be together, where all are dignified, equal and worthy of freedom. The united voices of the girls around the world rings loud and clear ahead of the start of the new moon. Intro for the album which is ’12:00’, it is promised time in the new space, capturing our story of getting into orbit.The titled track ‘Why Not?’ is an uptempo electronic pop song, with a story of pursuing freedom and individualistic self. The funky and bubbly bass line reminiscent of the Midnight Festival is impressive. The key change in the song, which started with a charismatic introduction, from the chorus to the witty major, it resembles LOOΠΔ who is about to change. ‘Voice’ is an energetic retro song with a low, repetitive beat that evokes addiction. It is meant to enjoy the feelings of love and to venture together in an uncontrollable excitement. ‘Fall Again’ has a story about falling back in love with the one every time fall returns. It is a Pop R&B, a harmonious blend of sentimental vocals and rhythmic instruments by LOOΠΔ. It gives the feeling of the seasonality of autumn abundant.  ‘Universe’ is a dreamy up-tempo electronic pop ballad with soft sweltering pads, ambient vocals and steady beat, adding warmth to the beat of love, attraction and temptation with the piano melody, allowing you to feel the song in its entirety.  ‘Hide & Seek’ is a cool, bright, poptastic uptempo dance song, which it coolly reveals one’s mind that is not hidden. It is showing confidence to the opponent, like playing hide & seek.  ‘OOPS!’ is a multi-groove pop song characterized by a cool, repetitive feeling and Latin undertones. It sends a message that the one will love oneself and live freely without caring about others anymore. In addition, ‘Star’ which is an English version of Voice, it is aimed at global fans, will be released at the same time, allowing them to enjoy various music sources.LOOΠΔs [12:00] album — where LOOΠΔ creates the inevitable through the merging of coincidence and fate.#이달의소녀 #LOONA #Midnight #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreativeMore about LOOΠΔ/LOOΠΔ Official : http://www.loonatheworld.comLOOΠΔ Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworldLOOΠΔ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworldCopyrights 2020 ⓒ BlockBerryCreative.
