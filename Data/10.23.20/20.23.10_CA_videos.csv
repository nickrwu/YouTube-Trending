How do we change that?What do you wish the presidential candidates would talk about? http://vox.com/ElectionVideosIn the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country’s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.This video is the seventh in our series on the 2020 election. We aren’t covering the horse race; instead, we want to explain the stakes of the election through the issues that matter most to you.

Find the last dragon. Watch the new trailer for Raya and the Last Dragon, in theaters March 2021.Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well. From directors Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada, co-directors Paul Briggs and John Ripa, producers Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho, and featuring the voices of Kelly Marie Tran as Raya and Awkwafina as the last dragon Sisu, Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Raya and the Last Dragon” opens in U.S. theaters on March 2021.Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/rayaandthelastdragonTwitter:  https://twitter.com/DisneyRayaInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/disneyraya/Hashtag: #DisneyRaya","2M3S"

First off, here's a little life update; We filmed this back in September but didn't get time to edit and upload the video until now. Immediately after filming our trip to Rocky Mountain Raceweek 2.0 (which is not in the Rocky Mountains), we left town to film Roadkill and Faster With Finnegan and we still aren't done filming those shows so we are working on Finnegan's Garage edits in our spare time. Anyway, since September, a lot has happened. I've bought a new enclosed ramp truck, which you'll briefly see in this video, I've traded away the six-door Ford F650 for a '66 Chevy Suburban, which you'll also see in this video, too. We also had a small shift linkage issue in Blasphemi during Rocky Mountain Raceweek 2.0, which resulted in a major engine failure-again, it's in this video. With any luck we'll upload Part 2 of the video next week. In that video, you'll see the rest of the road trip and you get to see my wife cry when I surprise her on our 15th wedding anniversary. :)03:37 If you'd like to grab the cool LED lights from WireCare.com we used on our trailer in this episode then go here: https://www.wirecare.com/interest/audio-visual/led/led-lighting-kits/as-rgb5mk2-5m-kit-rgb-5050-led-strip-44kyCheck out Rugged Radios which we would have used way more if not for the small engine failure!:https://www.ruggedradios.comIf you'd like your own Finnegan Speed and Marine shirt, hats or stickers then go here: www.fsmgarage.comAll proceeds will go toward fixing the damn Hemi-again! lolthanks!-Finnegan","31M52S"

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Ryan Gallagher Shines on Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion's The Prayer - Voice Blind Auditions 2020https://youtu.be/dY3PpXOH520The Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","6M6S"

Tune in to our live broadcast as our spacecraft descends to the surface of asteroid Bennu, touches down for a few seconds & attempts to capture regolith (rocks and dust) using a “Touch-And-Go,” or TAG, maneuver. The spacecraft must target Bennu’s rocky surface with great accuracy, touching down within a rocky area just 52 ft (16 m) in diameter. During the maneuver, the spacecraft and the asteroid will be approximately 207 million miles (334 million km) from Earth.Live coverage from Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, Colorado, with mission managers from the University of Arizona, Lockheed Martin, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center begins at 5 p.m. EDT. The spacecraft is scheduled to depart Bennu in 2021, and to deliver the collected sample to Earth on Sep. 24, 2023. It will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth, and the largest sample returned from space since the Apollo era.","1H28M43S"

I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.Stay safe ❤️ see you next video.👕 merch:https://crowdmade.com/collections/icecreamsandwich📱 twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy📷 instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

It conveys powerful support and comfort to the youth with limitless potentials.#SEVENTEEN #세븐틴#Semicolon #세미콜론#HOME_RUNSEVENTEEN Official Homepage : http://www.seventeen-17.comSEVENTEEN Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/seventeennewsSEVENTEEN Official Twitter : https://twitter.com/pledis_17SEVENTEEN Official Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/saythename_17SEVENTEEN Official Fancafe : http://cafe.daum.net/pledis-17SEVENTEEN Official Weverse : https://www.weverse.io/seventeenⓒ Pledis Entertainment.

On this occasion, they will hold a Moonlight festival at [12:00], when the moon shines the brightest—a festival where no girl will feel silenced.LOOΠΔ makes coincidence when destiny collides with fate, and finds her destiny within coincidence and fate to deliver a new message for the Midnight Festival.  ‘With all LOOΠΔs around the world’, all of the LOOΠΔs across the globe will always be together, where all are dignified, equal and worthy of freedom. The united voices of the girls around the world rings loud and clear ahead of the start of the new moon. Intro for the album which is ’12:00’, it is promised time in the new space, capturing our story of getting into orbit.The titled track ‘Why Not?’ is an uptempo electronic pop song, with a story of pursuing freedom and individualistic self. The funky and bubbly bass line reminiscent of the Midnight Festival is impressive. The key change in the song, which started with a charismatic introduction, from the chorus to the witty major, it resembles LOOΠΔ who is about to change. ‘Voice’ is an energetic retro song with a low, repetitive beat that evokes addiction. It is meant to enjoy the feelings of love and to venture together in an uncontrollable excitement. ‘Fall Again’ has a story about falling back in love with the one every time fall returns. It is a Pop R&B, a harmonious blend of sentimental vocals and rhythmic instruments by LOOΠΔ. It gives the feeling of the seasonality of autumn abundant.  ‘Universe’ is a dreamy up-tempo electronic pop ballad with soft sweltering pads, ambient vocals and steady beat, adding warmth to the beat of love, attraction and temptation with the piano melody, allowing you to feel the song in its entirety.  ‘Hide & Seek’ is a cool, bright, poptastic uptempo dance song, which it coolly reveals one’s mind that is not hidden. It is showing confidence to the opponent, like playing hide & seek.  ‘OOPS!’ is a multi-groove pop song characterized by a cool, repetitive feeling and Latin undertones. It sends a message that the one will love oneself and live freely without caring about others anymore. In addition, ‘Star’ which is an English version of Voice, it is aimed at global fans, will be released at the same time, allowing them to enjoy various music sources.LOOΠΔs [12:00] album — where LOOΠΔ creates the inevitable through the merging of coincidence and fate.#이달의소녀 #LOONA #Midnight #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreativeMore about LOOΠΔ/LOOΠΔ Official : http://www.loonatheworld.comLOOΠΔ Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworldLOOΠΔ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworldCopyrights 2020 ⓒ BlockBerryCreative.

That came in the form of The Hobbit trilogy, starring Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. The only problem? While The Lord of the Rings trilogy was based on a trilogy of books, The Hobbit trilogy was based off a single one. So yeah-- there’s a lot of filler.The Desolation of Smaug definitely raises some questions. Like why do these dwarves keep getting captured every few minutes? Is Bilbo really going to have to use the ring every time to help them escape? Why does he keep removing it in key action scenes? Why is Legolas here? How did they think they’d be able to take down a dragon using heat? Why does this movie just kind of end?To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug!

But the royal existence isn't always a fairy tale, and this prince has seen his fair share of hardship and heartbreak. These are some of the tragic details about Prince William.Prince William's parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, went through a very messy, very public divorce - which was also incredibly prolonged. Charles and Diana first announced their separation in 1992, when William was just ten years old. Given their popular union and the royal family's historically fraught relationship with divorce, however, it was several years before they made the split official.Even after announcing their separation, the Prince of Wales and the People's Princess continued to carry out their royal duties, according to the History Channel. However, their already-strained relationship continued to deteriorate, with much of the drama playing out in the public eye. In November 1995, when a 13-year-old Prince William was attending boarding school, his mother gave an explosive, tell-all interview about her marriage. Airing on BBC One's Panorama, one of the most memorable moments came when Diana was asked if Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' then-alleged mistress and now-wife, played a role in the breakdown of the union. She famously replied,Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.According to royal biographer Katie Nicholl, William was reportedly mortified by this deeply personal interview - not only had his peers watched, but he was hounded by the paparazzi.Eventually, Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, urged the two to formally divorce, which they did in August 1996. Divorce isn't easy for any child, but for William, the very public breakdown of his parents' marriage was reportedly extra traumatic. One royal expert claimed in the 2017 documentary Kate: The Making of a Modern Queen,I think that he was quite seriously affected by the bad relationship of his parents.Watch the video for more Tragic Details About Prince William.#RoyalFamily #PrinceWilliam #PrincessDianaMessy Divorce | 0:00Diana's Death | 1:55Lingering pains | 2:37Dating William | 3:53Kate's privacy | 4:58Family safety | 6:18Accused of infidelity | 7:28Mental health | 8:39Strained relationship | 9:57Public speaking anxiety | 11:14Read Full Article: https://www.nickiswift.com/220453/tragic-details-about-prince-william/","12M16S"

Remember? The Cavs were like “sure we’ll build around you Kyrie, you’re our guy” and then LeBron said he was coming back to Cleveland, and then the Cavs were like “what’s a Kyrie???”.The 2016 Finals were so good. I mean, it went to seven games, which is exciting enough! But there was so much more! In this video we relive every single part of the series, and everything that lead up to it too — from the Warriors’ insane record-setting seasons full of threes to LeBron’s chasedown blocks to the playoff groin shots.
