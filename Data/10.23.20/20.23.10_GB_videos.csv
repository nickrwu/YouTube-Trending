How do we change that?What do you wish the presidential candidates would talk about? http://vox.com/ElectionVideosIn the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country’s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.This video is the seventh in our series on the 2020 election. We aren’t covering the horse race; instead, we want to explain the stakes of the election through the issues that matter most to you.

Find the last dragon. Watch the new trailer for Raya and the Last Dragon, in theaters March 2021.Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well. From directors Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada, co-directors Paul Briggs and John Ripa, producers Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho, and featuring the voices of Kelly Marie Tran as Raya and Awkwafina as the last dragon Sisu, Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Raya and the Last Dragon” opens in U.S. theaters on March 2021.Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/rayaandthelastdragonTwitter:  https://twitter.com/DisneyRayaInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/disneyraya/Hashtag: #DisneyRaya","2M3S"

Tune in to our live broadcast as our spacecraft descends to the surface of asteroid Bennu, touches down for a few seconds & attempts to capture regolith (rocks and dust) using a “Touch-And-Go,” or TAG, maneuver. The spacecraft must target Bennu’s rocky surface with great accuracy, touching down within a rocky area just 52 ft (16 m) in diameter. During the maneuver, the spacecraft and the asteroid will be approximately 207 million miles (334 million km) from Earth.Live coverage from Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, Colorado, with mission managers from the University of Arizona, Lockheed Martin, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center begins at 5 p.m. EDT. The spacecraft is scheduled to depart Bennu in 2021, and to deliver the collected sample to Earth on Sep. 24, 2023. It will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth, and the largest sample returned from space since the Apollo era.","1H28M43S"

Since the release of infectious rap anthem ‘Frontline’ via Mixtape Madness, the 22-year-old from Coventry has established himself as a leading light within Britain’s flourishing rap landscape. Armed with a distinct, melodic cadence that incorporates influences from his Gambian heritage, Salieu has forged his identity into a unique brand of rap that is quickly drawing attention and applause from wide quarters. The early momentum of ‘Frontline’ has continued with a string of feature verses over the last few months. He connected with South London’s SL for ‘Hit the Block,’ as well as Meekz, M1llionz and Teeway on ‘Year of the Real.’ He also joined Backroad Gee and Ambush for the remix to street heater ‘Party Popper’ on GRM Daily. The next stage in his journey sees him release the tracks ‘Bang Out’ and ‘Betty’, prior to an upcoming mixtape. #PaSalieu #Black","1M55S"

I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.Stay safe ❤️ see you next video.👕 merch:https://crowdmade.com/collections/icecreamsandwich📱 twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy📷 instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

Head to https://www.carwow.co.uk to find the right car from the right dealer, at the right price..............................................................It's time for a BMW Touring showdown! We've got an F81 M3 Touring going head-to-head with the new BMW M340i xDrive Touring! Now we know what you BMW fanboys will be saying - BMW never made an F81 M3 Touring. And you're right, they didn't... So what you're seeing here is a custom-built, one-of-a-kind exclusive. The owner took a BMW 320d, and then took all the parts from an M3 F80 and built THIS! Not only that, but the engine's also been tuned, so the 3-litre straight-six turbo now delivers 540hp & 680Nm! Now it may have more power than the M340i, which can 'only' produce 374hp & 500Nm of torque, but it does have one advantage - it's got all-wheel drive, whereas the M3 only has rear-wheel drive! Will it be enough to power the 'M3 Lite' to victory?

On this occasion, they will hold a Moonlight festival at [12:00], when the moon shines the brightest—a festival where no girl will feel silenced.LOOΠΔ makes coincidence when destiny collides with fate, and finds her destiny within coincidence and fate to deliver a new message for the Midnight Festival.  ‘With all LOOΠΔs around the world’, all of the LOOΠΔs across the globe will always be together, where all are dignified, equal and worthy of freedom. The united voices of the girls around the world rings loud and clear ahead of the start of the new moon. Intro for the album which is ’12:00’, it is promised time in the new space, capturing our story of getting into orbit.The titled track ‘Why Not?’ is an uptempo electronic pop song, with a story of pursuing freedom and individualistic self. The funky and bubbly bass line reminiscent of the Midnight Festival is impressive. The key change in the song, which started with a charismatic introduction, from the chorus to the witty major, it resembles LOOΠΔ who is about to change. ‘Voice’ is an energetic retro song with a low, repetitive beat that evokes addiction. It is meant to enjoy the feelings of love and to venture together in an uncontrollable excitement. ‘Fall Again’ has a story about falling back in love with the one every time fall returns. It is a Pop R&B, a harmonious blend of sentimental vocals and rhythmic instruments by LOOΠΔ. It gives the feeling of the seasonality of autumn abundant.  ‘Universe’ is a dreamy up-tempo electronic pop ballad with soft sweltering pads, ambient vocals and steady beat, adding warmth to the beat of love, attraction and temptation with the piano melody, allowing you to feel the song in its entirety.  ‘Hide & Seek’ is a cool, bright, poptastic uptempo dance song, which it coolly reveals one’s mind that is not hidden. It is showing confidence to the opponent, like playing hide & seek.  ‘OOPS!’ is a multi-groove pop song characterized by a cool, repetitive feeling and Latin undertones. It sends a message that the one will love oneself and live freely without caring about others anymore. In addition, ‘Star’ which is an English version of Voice, it is aimed at global fans, will be released at the same time, allowing them to enjoy various music sources.LOOΠΔs [12:00] album — where LOOΠΔ creates the inevitable through the merging of coincidence and fate.#이달의소녀 #LOONA #Midnight #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreativeMore about LOOΠΔ/LOOΠΔ Official : http://www.loonatheworld.comLOOΠΔ Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworldLOOΠΔ Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/LOOΠΔ Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworldCopyrights 2020 ⓒ BlockBerryCreative.

If you don't have any weights home - don't worry! I got you ♥︎ / Werbung I use a 10kg / 22 lbs dumbbell. Choose a weight that feels good for you! Weights help us to increase the intensity of a workout, build rounder muscles (booty alarm) and make us stronger! Your home-made weight: 1. Take a bag 2. Search for dense + heavy food in your kitchen. For example: packs of flour, rice, oats, etc. 3. You can easily put 6 to 10 packs into one bag. That makes 6 to 10 kg :) This workout is structured like this: - a Booty Activation, without equipment  - 6 Supersets, including 1-2 weighted exercise(s) and a bodyweight burner - a Burnout with 6min of Glute Bridges, to make those butt cheeks buuuuurnThings to keep in mind: ▸ bodyweight focusses on your HEELS, don't shift your bodyweight onto your toes▸ your BACK stays STRAIGHT. Don't round it! ▸ keep your KNEES stable. Never collapse them inwards, rather push them a bit outwards ▸ squeeze your BOOTY as hard as possible and hold the tension as long as possible, if you have troubles with only growing your thighs. The routine includes breaks! Yes, that's correct.

She films and edits the “Squirmy and Grubs” vlog, which has over 670,000 subscribers on YouTube. Hannah has spoken at prestigious universities and Fortune 500 companies alike about the realities of ableism. On her popular Instagram account, she advocates for acceptance of all people and works to improve the way society thinks about disability.Shane and Hannah have been together for over four years. They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as “normal” as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together.","13M2S"

The previous explosive bat was cool, but it wasn't setting any records. I set out to design a bat that could beat Babe Ruth's home run record of 575 feet. The engineering was intense but the results are spectacular. Aside from attempts on the record, you can also look forward to some awesome high speed footage of the bat in action and a special guest.This video could not have been made without the help of Destin from Smarter Every Day. Not only did he provide the high speed camera, he also shared all his footage from testing the bat. He made a more in depth video on what happens when this this bat goes boom. Check it out!

That came in the form of The Hobbit trilogy, starring Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. The only problem? While The Lord of the Rings trilogy was based on a trilogy of books, The Hobbit trilogy was based off a single one. So yeah-- there’s a lot of filler.The Desolation of Smaug definitely raises some questions. Like why do these dwarves keep getting captured every few minutes? Is Bilbo really going to have to use the ring every time to help them escape? Why does he keep removing it in key action scenes? Why is Legolas here? How did they think they’d be able to take down a dragon using heat? Why does this movie just kind of end?To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug!

It conveys powerful support and comfort to the youth with limitless potentials.#SEVENTEEN #세븐틴#Semicolon #세미콜론#HOME_RUNSEVENTEEN Official Homepage : http://www.seventeen-17.comSEVENTEEN Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/seventeennewsSEVENTEEN Official Twitter : https://twitter.com/pledis_17SEVENTEEN Official Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/saythename_17SEVENTEEN Official Fancafe : http://cafe.daum.net/pledis-17SEVENTEEN Official Weverse : https://www.weverse.io/seventeenⓒ Pledis Entertainment.

But the royal existence isn't always a fairy tale, and this prince has seen his fair share of hardship and heartbreak. These are some of the tragic details about Prince William.Prince William's parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, went through a very messy, very public divorce - which was also incredibly prolonged. Charles and Diana first announced their separation in 1992, when William was just ten years old. Given their popular union and the royal family's historically fraught relationship with divorce, however, it was several years before they made the split official.Even after announcing their separation, the Prince of Wales and the People's Princess continued to carry out their royal duties, according to the History Channel. However, their already-strained relationship continued to deteriorate, with much of the drama playing out in the public eye. In November 1995, when a 13-year-old Prince William was attending boarding school, his mother gave an explosive, tell-all interview about her marriage. Airing on BBC One's Panorama, one of the most memorable moments came when Diana was asked if Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' then-alleged mistress and now-wife, played a role in the breakdown of the union. She famously replied,Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.According to royal biographer Katie Nicholl, William was reportedly mortified by this deeply personal interview - not only had his peers watched, but he was hounded by the paparazzi.Eventually, Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, urged the two to formally divorce, which they did in August 1996. Divorce isn't easy for any child, but for William, the very public breakdown of his parents' marriage was reportedly extra traumatic. One royal expert claimed in the 2017 documentary Kate: The Making of a Modern Queen,I think that he was quite seriously affected by the bad relationship of his parents.Watch the video for more Tragic Details About Prince William.#RoyalFamily #PrinceWilliam #PrincessDianaMessy Divorce | 0:00Diana's Death | 1:55Lingering pains | 2:37Dating William | 3:53Kate's privacy | 4:58Family safety | 6:18Accused of infidelity | 7:28Mental health | 8:39Strained relationship | 9:57Public speaking anxiety | 11:14Read Full Article: https://www.nickiswift.com/220453/tragic-details-about-prince-william/","12M16S"
