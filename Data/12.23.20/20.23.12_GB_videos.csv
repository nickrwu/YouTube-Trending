This video is meant to refute these claims. I encourage everyone to watch until the end, especially if they watched the original video.In this video we hear from a statistical expert with a PhD that wrote a 19 page analysis on what the mods did wrong. I also disprove some of the claims made in the original video. All relevant information should be viewable below.Although I would have loved to attempt to refute the math myself, I suck at math and would have looked like a complete idiot.

Instead, he becomes embroiled in the search for a killer who is terrorizing the city. Leading the hunt, L.A. Sheriff Department Sergeant Jim Baxter (Malek), impressed with Deke‚Äôs cop instincts, unofficially engages his help. But as they track the killer, Baxter is unaware that the investigation is dredging up echoes of Deke‚Äôs past, uncovering disturbing secrets that could threaten more than his case.The main cast also includes Natalie Morales (‚ÄúBattle of the Sexes‚Äù), Terry Kinney (‚ÄúMile 22,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBillions‚Äù), Chris Bauer (‚ÄúSully,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Deuce‚Äù), Joris Jarsky (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBad Blood‚Äù), Isabel Arraiza (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúPearson‚Äù) and Michael Hyatt (‚ÄúCrazy Ex-Girlfriend‚Äù).‚ÄúThe Little Things‚Äù is produced by Oscar- and Emmy-winning producer Mark Johnson (‚ÄúBreaking Bad,‚Äù ‚ÄúRain Man‚Äù) and Hancock, with Mike Drake and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers.Behind the scenes, Hancock reunited with several longtime collaborators, including Oscar-nominated director of photography John Schwartzman (‚ÄúSeabiscuit,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Founder,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Mr. Banks‚Äù), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (‚ÄúApollo 13,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Founder,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Blind Side‚Äù) editor Robert Frazen (‚ÄúThe Founder‚Äù), and costume designer Daniel Orlandi (‚ÄúThe Founder,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Blind Side‚Äù). The music is by multiple Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (‚Äú1917,‚Äù ‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Mr. Banks‚Äù).Warner Bros. Pictures presents A Gran Via Production, ‚ÄúThe Little Things‚Äù will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film has slated for release on January 29, 2021 in theaters and on HBO Max and has been rated R for violent/disturbing images, language and full nudity.","2M25S"

Unlike conventional airplanes, tail sitting planes rested on their tails and used engine power alone to lift off the ground before transitioning to vertical flight, and returning to land vertically once again on their tail. The configuration, although technically challenging to develop, would allow aircraft to operate without runways, fundamentally changing how and where air forces could use their aircraft. In the early 1950s French aerospace firm SNECMA (Soci√©t√© nationale d'√©tudes et de construction de moteurs d'aviation) began developing wingless test rigs to prove the viability of the tail sitting concept. At the time, American firms were also developing tail sitting prototypes of their own, But SNECMA would take it a step further by developing a tail sitting aircraft with a highly unconventional annular (cylindrical) wing. The cylindrical wing promised greater efficiency over a conventional wing by eliminating wing-tip vortices. It would also be more compact, further reducing the space needed for vertical take-off and landings. French designers also theorised that a cylindrical wing could eventually be engineered to function as a ramjet engine, propelling the aircraft to supersonic speeds.The C.450 Coleoptere was constructed in 1958, with tethered flight testing beginning in early 1959. By May, the unconventional plane had achieved its first successful unassisted hover, even reaching altitudes of 800 meters. Despite early successes during flight tests, flaws soon emerged in the aircraft‚Äôs design. The Coleoptere proved extremely difficult to pilot. An innovative pilot seat could swivel 90 degrees, but pilots still struggled to judge the aircraft‚Äôs distance from the ground while landing. Without a conventional wing to provide resistance, the Coleoptere also had a tendency to slowly spin on its axis. On July 25, 1959, the Coleoptere performed it‚Äôs 9th test flight. This time, the pilot was to transition the aircraft from vertical to horizontal flight, a challenging procedure that would mark a huge milestone for the program. The Coleoptere lifted off successfully, but during its transition, it suddenly became too inclined and slow-moving to maintain altitude. The aircraft started tumbling back to earth as the pilot struggled to regain control, barely managing to eject at the very last minute. The Coleoptere was destroyed.A second prototype of the Coleoptere would never be built. By the 1960‚Äôs it was clear that the tail sitting configuration was a dead-end. It was simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload and range, and far too difficult to pilot. It was clear that vectoring thrust, allowing the aircraft to remain horizontal, was a more practical and safer solution.

This ‚ÄúGreat Conjunction‚Äù happens next on December 21, 2020, but this time, Jupiter and Saturn will be closer than they‚Äôve been in nearly 400 years.  December 21 also happens to be the night of the winter solstice, and the peak of the Ursid meteor shower. For most Great Conjunctions, Jupiter and Saturn are separated by about 1 degree, which is the width of two full¬†moons¬†in the sky. This year, they will be separated by just one-tenth of a degree, which is one-fifth the size of the full¬†moon. A Great Conjunction happens every 20 years, but the last time Jupiter and Saturn were this close was the year 1623.Join Lowell Observatory at 5pm MST on Monday, December 21, 2020, to celebrate the Great Conjunction with an evening of telescope viewing and commentary from Lowell's own astronomers and educators.#ChristmasStar","2H32M10S"

This close approach of the two planets is called a great conjunction and occurs when the independent movements of Jupiter and Saturn make them appear close together in the sky. This happens once every 20 years, but they have not been seen this close together since 1226 A.D.If we have clear skies, this conjunction may be seen in the southwestern sky shortly after dark on December 21, and it should be visible from roughly 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Jupiter and Saturn will be very close together. Anyone will be able to see the pair with unaided eyes. No telescope or binoculars is required, but a magnified view through a Griffith Observatory telescope will be live streamed. You can also observe both planets and their moons through your own telescope.LIVE WEBCAST: Griffith Observatory will start streaming the winter solstice great conjunction to our YouTube page on Monday, December 21, 2020, at 4:30 p.m., PST. The program will begin with a live view of the sunset, which occurs at 4:48 p.m., PST. A telescopic view of Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction will be streamed live as soon as acquired, in the twilight, perhaps by 5:00 p.m., PST.","2H29M24S"

Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Italy have all announced restrictions, including bans on flights and trains from the UK. France and Germany are said to be considering similar action. This comes after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced tougher measures to combat the new virus strain. Officials say while the new mutation is much more easily transmitted, it's not thought to be any more dangerous.Concern about the new strain has led British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reverse plans to ease coronavirus restrictions over the Christmas period. He has imposed an effective lockdown on London and southeast England. The move has made the capital - usually bustling with shoppers at this time of year - almost unrecognizable. Millions of people have been forced to cancel their Christmas plans under the new restrictions. The Prime Minister is facing widespread criticism for the decision. However Britain's health secretary says the government had to take quick action.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnewsF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#NewStrain #Coronavirus #Pandemic","7M1S"

"vk5wbpzspWE","Squishy Makeovers: Spin The Wheel | Fixing Your Squishies #25","2020-12-18T21:00:29Z","UCYAB7hh1ohA8-iX54EpMdeA","Moriah Elizabeth","24","20.23.12","[none]","2646928","137460","1306","25557","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vk5wbpzspWE/default.jpg","False","False","Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Fixing and giving makeovers to squishies is such a fun painting project, and a great creative art activity. It's been keeping me busy for years üòÇ Hopefully you like my creations this episode. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

The draconian bracket will see non-essential shops  shut, and travel restrictions including a 'stay at home' order for Christmas Day itself - even though Mr Johnson insisted just days ago that it would be 'inhuman' to axe five-day festive 'bubbles'. Christmas plans for millions of Londoners were thrown into doubt by the Prime Minister's announcement, with many planning on travelling out of the capital during the relaxation of coronavirus measures between December 23 and 27. But with the planned relaxation cancelled, and the new rules coming into force from midnight, people were tonight scrambling to get out of London while they still could.Original Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9071155/Huge-queues-train-stations-desperate-Londoners-flee-capital-ahead-Tier-4.htmlOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/coronaviruslockdowns/video-2317042/Video-Couple-reacts-Tier-4-update-Christmas-plans-cancelled.htmlDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymailDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymailDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033Daily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnlineDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymailDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMailGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile","1M36S"
