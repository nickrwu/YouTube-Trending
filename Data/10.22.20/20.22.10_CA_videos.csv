Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show‚Äôs innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist‚Äôs voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Ryan Gallagher Shines on Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion's The Prayer - Voice Blind Auditions 2020https://youtu.be/dY3PpXOH520The Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","6M6S"

I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.Stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è see you next video.üëï merch:https://crowdmade.com/collections/icecreamsandwichüì± twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuyüì∑ instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

On this occasion, they will hold a Moonlight festival at [12:00], when the moon shines the brightest‚Äîa festival where no girl will feel silenced.LOOŒ†Œî makes coincidence when destiny collides with fate, and finds her destiny within coincidence and fate to deliver a new message for the Midnight Festival.  ‚ÄòWith all LOOŒ†Œîs around the world‚Äô, all of the LOOŒ†Œîs across the globe will always be together, where all are dignified, equal and worthy of freedom. The united voices of the girls around the world rings loud and clear ahead of the start of the new moon. Intro for the album which is ‚Äô12:00‚Äô, it is promised time in the new space, capturing our story of getting into orbit.The titled track ‚ÄòWhy Not?‚Äô is an uptempo electronic pop song, with a story of pursuing freedom and individualistic self. The funky and bubbly bass line reminiscent of the Midnight Festival is impressive. The key change in the song, which started with a charismatic introduction, from the chorus to the witty major, it resembles LOOŒ†Œî who is about to change. ‚ÄòVoice‚Äô is an energetic retro song with a low, repetitive beat that evokes addiction. It is meant to enjoy the feelings of love and to venture together in an uncontrollable excitement. ‚ÄòFall Again‚Äô has a story about falling back in love with the one every time fall returns. It is a Pop R&B, a harmonious blend of sentimental vocals and rhythmic instruments by LOOŒ†Œî. It gives the feeling of the seasonality of autumn abundant.  ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô is a dreamy up-tempo electronic pop ballad with soft sweltering pads, ambient vocals and steady beat, adding warmth to the beat of love, attraction and temptation with the piano melody, allowing you to feel the song in its entirety.  ‚ÄòHide & Seek‚Äô is a cool, bright, poptastic uptempo dance song, which it coolly reveals one‚Äôs mind that is not hidden. It is showing confidence to the opponent, like playing hide & seek.  ‚ÄòOOPS!‚Äô is a multi-groove pop song characterized by a cool, repetitive feeling and Latin undertones. It sends a message that the one will love oneself and live freely without caring about others anymore. In addition, ‚ÄòStar‚Äô which is an English version of Voice, it is aimed at global fans, will be released at the same time, allowing them to enjoy various music sources.LOOŒ†Œîs [12:00] album ‚Äî where LOOŒ†Œî creates the inevitable through the merging of coincidence and fate.#Ïù¥Îã¨ÏùòÏÜåÎÖÄ #LOONA #Midnight #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreativeMore about LOOŒ†Œî/LOOŒ†Œî Official : http://www.loonatheworld.comLOOŒ†Œî Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/LOOŒ†Œî Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworldLOOŒ†Œî Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/LOOŒ†Œî Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworldCopyrights 2020 ‚ìí BlockBerryCreative.

But the royal existence isn't always a fairy tale, and this prince has seen his fair share of hardship and heartbreak. These are some of the tragic details about Prince William.Prince William's parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, went through a very messy, very public divorce - which was also incredibly prolonged. Charles and Diana first announced their separation in 1992, when William was just ten years old. Given their popular union and the royal family's historically fraught relationship with divorce, however, it was several years before they made the split official.Even after announcing their separation, the Prince of Wales and the People's Princess continued to carry out their royal duties, according to the History Channel. However, their already-strained relationship continued to deteriorate, with much of the drama playing out in the public eye. In November 1995, when a 13-year-old Prince William was attending boarding school, his mother gave an explosive, tell-all interview about her marriage. Airing on BBC One's Panorama, one of the most memorable moments came when Diana was asked if Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' then-alleged mistress and now-wife, played a role in the breakdown of the union. She famously replied,Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.According to royal biographer Katie Nicholl, William was reportedly mortified by this deeply personal interview - not only had his peers watched, but he was hounded by the paparazzi.Eventually, Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, urged the two to formally divorce, which they did in August 1996. Divorce isn't easy for any child, but for William, the very public breakdown of his parents' marriage was reportedly extra traumatic. One royal expert claimed in the 2017 documentary Kate: The Making of a Modern Queen,I think that he was quite seriously affected by the bad relationship of his parents.Watch the video for more Tragic Details About Prince William.#RoyalFamily #PrinceWilliam #PrincessDianaMessy Divorce | 0:00Diana's Death | 1:55Lingering pains | 2:37Dating William | 3:53Kate's privacy | 4:58Family safety | 6:18Accused of infidelity | 7:28Mental health | 8:39Strained relationship | 9:57Public speaking anxiety | 11:14Read Full Article: https://www.nickiswift.com/220453/tragic-details-about-prince-william/","12M16S"

That came in the form of The Hobbit trilogy, starring Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. The only problem? While The Lord of the Rings trilogy was based on a trilogy of books, The Hobbit trilogy was based off a single one. So yeah-- there‚Äôs a lot of filler.The Desolation of Smaug definitely raises some questions. Like why do these dwarves keep getting captured every few minutes? Is Bilbo really going to have to use the ring every time to help them escape? Why does he keep removing it in key action scenes? Why is Legolas here?

I think I got it all out of my system for the time being. Today, we attempt to jump a mountain bike and RC car over a tabletop at the same time. It turns out that this isn't nearly as easy as sending the car or bike alone, as they actually travel at different speeds to clear the same jump. After some technical problems and a steep learning curve, we finally figure out that a bigger battery makes it much easier to time. Here's the car Traxxas sent ushttps://traxxas.com/products/landing/maxx/If you're interested in the Maxx, just go to your local hobby shop and they will probably have it. You'll also need a charger, battery, and probably some tools. This thing is an absolute beast! It might need a little polishing after landing upside down about 300 times.
