The Impostor (who looks identical to the other players) kills off the crew members one-by-one.  After each death, the crew has an opportunity to vote one member off the ship, launching them into space to perish in hopes of getting rid of the Impostor.  Impostors have the unique ability to travel though a vent system on the spaceship, but must do so without being seen by other players - this puts them at immediate risk of being identified as the Imposter.Animation by me, narration by @ftwinzgottalent : https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJmSkD6X/Learn this software for free through my Autodesk Maya Beginner Essentials training course playlist here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHTiqada2E2CTu1ptM5LdN-yMUk97ZguW#Shorts #YouTubeShorts","43S"

Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually  poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan...It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders  to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse.What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?OUR CHANNELS▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀German Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDESpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeESHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀This is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!Get Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  Join the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  DISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀Reddit:            https://kgs.link/redditInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagramTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitterFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebookDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discordNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletterOUR VOICE▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀The Kurzgesagt voice is from Steve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voiceOUR MUSIC ♬♪▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:Spotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotifySoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloudBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcampYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtubeFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebookThe Soundtrack of this video:Soundcloud:   https://bit.ly/3jmaA12Bandcamp:     https://bit.ly/3mhAKE3 🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀Many Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:Ulgry MadHats, AleMez, lady-shroom, Marek Matas, Mitzy Sosa, Mattia Failla, Eugen Lounkine, Frankie Eder, Denis, Brian Wilson, Logan Allen, Martin Mägar, Bence Szebenyi, Jacob Michael, Maddy Berry, Sergey Voronov, Spiccy Panda, Domino Puttick, Morten Kahn, David, pascalfire, Dallas, Bruno Poli, Milka3105, Jonathan King, Matthew Jones, Giacomo Costanzi, Andre M, Thomas Fitchette, Jacob Ashton, Ryouran, Alexander Hansen, Omri Klag, Isak Ellmer, Shadmere, Rachel Smith, Eric Hegi, novatril, Ilya Kustov, Varsha Vidushi, Josef Vondrák, Taus Ahmed, Nicholas Smith, Apokalypsor, Max Strieder, Tim Tufts, Michelle S, David Bowman, Maxell Richardson, Jane Valley, StukaJi86, Max, Umar Kabz, Jonathan Krailler, Illia Tulupov, Kyle Begovich, Christopher B Kaehny, Tatiana Jiménez, Jon Tiburzi, ivo galic, Cole Stewart-Johnson, Ryan Everts, Alexia Colon, MightyGremlin, JT Schley, Eric Thorne, Farid Nader Nejad, mahan gopalan, Louisa O'Brien, Matija Potocnik, Margrethe N.

In the new series, when California governor Zack Morris gets into hot water for closing too many underfunded high schools, he proposes they send the affected students to the most well-funded schools in the state – including Bayside High. The influx of new students gives the privileged Bayside kids (who never have a problem that can't be solved in twenty-two minutes) a much-needed dose of reality. Elizabeth Berkley Lauren and Mario Lopez star in the new SAVED BY THE BELL series, reprising their roles as Jessie Spano and A.C. Slater. John Michael Higgins also stars as Principal Toddman alongside the new class featuring Belmont Cameli, Dexter Darden, Mitchell Hoog, Alycia Pascual-Peña, Josie Totah and Haskiri Velazquez. Tracey Wigfield serves as writer and executive producer for the series, alongside executive producer Franco Bario. Peter Engel also serves as executive producer. SAVED BY THE BELL is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group.","2M9S"

Cohen said ‘he did what he did,’ and urged audiences to come to their own conclusions after watching the movie. Giuliani fired back on Twitter earlier this week, calling the scene a ‘complete fabrication.’ Cohen was joined by his co-star, Maria Bakalova, on GMA, who said she ‘felt safe’ while filming the scene with Giuliani.Exclusives from #ETonline :https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQwITQ__CeH2Y_7g2xeiNDa0vQsROQQgv","3M17S"

However, the official video of the run poses many questions that introduce an element of doubt, so let's investigate and determine if everything is what it seems...SSC report that on 10th October, 2020, the Tuatara in production specification form broke a top speed record with one direction at 331.15mph and the other at 301.07mph for an average of 316.1mph - beating the previous record of the Koenigsegg Agera RS by 38.2mph (from 277.9mph). The runs took place on the very same road, the Nevada Highway 160 from the intersection with Tecopa Road with the Tuatara's fastest direction heading South-East towards Las Vegas and the slow speed on the return.After plenty of time spent viewing the videos and analysing the data presented from the run so far, let's calculate whether it's possible and investigate further into these numbers. There are a number of areas that don't quite add up; from the time travelling between the fixed medians on the road and the painted street markings, to the dashboard and telemetry data being out of sync, and also on the technical side with the engine and gearbox configuration.A further topic of discussion not mentioned is the noticeable lag between the shift points recorded by the telemetry data which can simply be seen coming a few seconds delayed in comparison to the visual cues of the shift and rev counter, plus the audible sound of the RPMs.This video asks questions, based on the information given so far. If there are answers, it would be fantastic to hear them and the accompanying data that lines up to prove that the record has indeed been broken.Thanks to Jey, Matt, Kaare, Robert, Misha and many more for their involvement.FACTUAL CORRECTION: The rear tyre setup is 345, not 335 which produces a maximum 6th gear speed of 477.67 km/h - 296.15 mph, 3mph faster than suggested.Information and data sources:BBC Top Gear 331mph Record video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N22JfNHiC1kSSC Tuatara vs Koenigsegg Agera RS head to head video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLoFKcH7zGoStart location for the run:https://goo.gl/maps/6ZzK3ZCppWJZqoxL6Oli Webb confirming 6th gear for the run:https://youtu.be/bkUuX5TLVes?t=204Comparative Data:Koenigsegg Agera RS 271.19mph in 5th Oct 2017Average run speed of 277.9mphSlower run SE, faster run NW of 284.55mphSSC Tuatara 331.15mph on 10th Oct 2020 Average run speed of 316.1mphFaster run SE, slower run NW of 301.07mphMedian Comparisons:Start to 1st medianDistance: 1.69km / 1.05mTime: 38.18s = 99.5mph avg1st to 2nd medianDistance: 1.81km / 1.13mTime: 22.64s = 179.7mph avgEntry at 192mph, exit at 307mph2nd to 3rd medianDistance: 2.28km / 1.42mTime: 28.24s including a pausePause is 3:82Total time: 24.40s = 209.5mph avgEntry at 307mph, exit at 242mph1st to 3rdTotal excluding the pause is 47.39s = 195mphEntry at 194mph, exit at 242mph, 331mph along the wayThanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150","21M15S"

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.","9M38S"

It was left in a barn near Hershey Pennsylvania before its first wash in 44 years! You'd expect this to be a complete detailing disaster because it was left untouched for so long...but the paint was in good condition despite being covered in filth and disgusting grime. In this barn find, we use AMMO Frothe to remove the first layer of dust and dirt to ensure the rubber seals did not leak if we power washed. Once confident, we power washed the paint, then compounded and polished with a Rupes polisher during our paint restoration. The Datsun 280z has since won several awards at Zcon and more information can be found at www.350mile280z.com.ADD DETAILING SIMULATOR TO WISH LIST HERE:https://store.steampowered.com/app/1433570/Car_Detailing_Simulator/AMMO Paint Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-paint-regimen-kit/AMMO Interior Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-interiorregimen-kit/AMMO Wheel Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-wheel-regimen-kit/For more how to car care videos & full product line: http://www.ammonyc.com Carpet Brush for hand drill: https://amzn.to/31F2PKLRapid Adhesive Remover: https://amzn.to/2WcuOjNMini Shampooer: https://amzn.to/2W7swlTHeadliner Adhesive: https://amzn.to/33Ts9OxWindow Squeegee: https://amzn.to/2BAcE1XInduction Heater: https://amzn.to/2N4YUBFFestool Vacuum: https://amzn.to/33PuKJkSteam Machine: https://www.ammonyc.com/shop/steam-machine/If you’re a car fanatic like me, click the link below to be notified of my latest AMMO videos, products, podcasts, website promo’s and to take our quick Detailing Survey!http://eepurl.com/dOZ6ybAMMO Formulas used in this video: https://www.ammonyc.com/Recommended products and tools approved by AMMO NYC: Megs D300 https://amzn.to/2BUnXSQFoam Applicator Pads https://amzn.to/2MVU7U6Foam Gun https://amzn.to/2PEgNubWheel Woolies https://amzn.to/32YhGBxTar Remover https://amzn.to/2pYK6gaTire Gel Applicator https://amzn.to/2MVcf0oFestool Vacuum https://amzn.to/31Vv6wNMilwaukee Fan https://amzn.to/2peO9VEMilwaukee Rapid Charge https://amzn.to/2Wp2UB7Festool Vacuum Crevice https://amzn.to/34benXDRupes Polisher 21 https://amzn.to/2NisKCQRupes Polisher 3-in. https://amzn.to/2Wnl9HjMegs Foam Polishing Disc 6 https://amzn.to/2PqILJDMegs Foam Cutting Disc 6 https://amzn.to/2MXPbOTRupes Bag https://amzn.to/2PulLcwPositector Paint Depth Gauge https://amzn.to/2JwqOpfMercury Spray Bottle https://amzn.to/2PrFRnNMasterblaster https://amzn.to/2C4Rt8FCR Spotless Water Filter https://amzn.to/31Y7DuWMegs MF finish 3 https://amzn.to/2N04UgpMegs MF finish 5 https://amzn.to/2Pulq9LMegs MF finish 6 https://amzn.to/2q1TO19Megs MF cutting 3 https://amzn.to/2BTDSAYMegs MF cutting 5 https://amzn.to/2Nju1tkMegs MF cutting 6 https://amzn.to/2q1TX4HBlack Wow https://amzn.to/2PtG4XHMegs M205 https://amzn.to/2JwrNprMegs M105 https://amzn.to/2Ps31dSRoboReel https://amzn.to/2Pud6qPSteam Machine VX5000 https://amzn.to/368WBGmElcometer Paint Depth https://amzn.to/2NkP52AScangrip I-view https://amzn.to/2BWIN3KScangrip D-Match 2 https://amzn.to/2q1VU1bGorilla Gloves https://amzn.to/36k2ZLgLong-handled Window Scrubber https://amzn.to/2JyxZgJLoew-Cornell Fine line painting pen https://amzn.to/2JMhPAzFight Tech Dust Mask https://amzn.to/34bPZVRCarpet Brushes https://amzn.to/2qQiWIxSubscribe to AMMO NYC for clean cars: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=AMMONYCdotcomFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AMMOnyc/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ammonyc/For more product info: http://www.ammonyc.com/AMMO NYC Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/user/AMMONYCdotcomIf this video was helpful, please give us a THUMBS UP!Disclaimer:Due to factors beyond the control of AMMO NYC, Larry Kosilla, and Make Rain Productions, we cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Desz Gets a 4-Chair Turn Singing Toni Braxton's Unbreak My Heart - The Voice Blind Auditions 2020https://youtu.be/S4Yy4V5BM4YThe Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","5M39S"

We've always envisioned moving into the woods by the lake and building our dream tiny cabin as a home base for us to come back to in between our international travels. We cannot wait to have a place to call our own!!

As it has for all of us this global pandemic has flipped our world upside down.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. Halting our dream of driving around the world was a hard pill to swallow which is why we knew we needed a big project to keep our mind + body busy while social distancing back here in Toronto. Enter building an off-grid tiny house on wheels!! But after nearly 6 months, we realized that our dreams of continuing van life across North America in our new van build were not a current reality with the state of the world. So, we've found ourselves pursuing something we've dreamed of since we first got together 8 years ago... a cabin in the woods 😊 Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourWhat's in Our Camera Bag? https://www.eamonandbec.com/blogWho are we?We're Eamon and Bec, a Toronto-based couple who live full-time in our self converted Sprinter Van!!

Our goal here is to inspire you to chase after your own dreams however big (or small... tiny homes anyone?) they may be!

Stan Van Gundy's system surrounded Dwight with a record-setting bunch of shooters, and there was a clear path forward to keep that team intact. Instead, GM Otis Smith tinkered with his roster. When that team failed to match the prior season's success, the tinkering continued, and things only got worse. Howard got restless, the Magic overreacted with some all-out moves, and before you knew it, the kings of the East hit rock bottom.This is the story of a team underrated for its revolutionary greatness, and how they lost their identity and their superstar just 4 years after a Finals appearance. This is the collapse that ended the first chapter of Dwight Howard's fascinating career.Written and produced by Seth RosenthalEdited by Jiazhen ZhangMotion graphics by Michael DasSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com","15M5S"

Unfortunately for Gaethje, a good gameplan wasn't enough to beat a perfect fighter. Nurmagomedov scored a win with a second-round submission, unifying his lightweight title with Gaethje's interim championship.Gaethje said leading up to the fight that he just needed to land solid kicks to the legs of Nurmagomedov to take away the champ's wrestling game and open him up to the challenger's huge power punches. The kicks did land, and Nurmagomedov's legs did seem to be starting to show some damage, but it only takes one moment for Nurmagomedov to put an opponent in a bad position.After a second-round leg kick from Gaethje, Nurmagomedov drove through a takedown and quickly moved to mount. After locking in a triangle choke, Nurmagomedov rolled to his back and squeezed the choke while Gaethje tapped out. Gaethje's taps were missed by the referee, leaving the challenger unconscious on the canvas.Following the fight, Nurmagomedov announced his retirement, stating he didn't want to return to the Octagon without his father, who died following COVID-19-related complications earlier this year.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#UFC #UFC245 #Khabib #JustinGaethje #MMA #Nurmagomedov #khabibNurmagomedov #FigtIsland","20M59S"
