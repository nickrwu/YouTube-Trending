Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Italy have all announced restrictions, including bans on flights and trains from the UK. France and Germany are said to be considering similar action. This comes after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced tougher measures to combat the new virus strain. Officials say while the new mutation is much more easily transmitted, it's not thought to be any more dangerous.Concern about the new strain has led British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reverse plans to ease coronavirus restrictions over the Christmas period. He has imposed an effective lockdown on London and southeast England. The move has made the capital - usually bustling with shoppers at this time of year - almost unrecognizable. Millions of people have been forced to cancel their Christmas plans under the new restrictions. The Prime Minister is facing widespread criticism for the decision. However Britain's health secretary says the government had to take quick action.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnewsFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#NewStrain #Coronavirus #Pandemic","7M1S"

I saw DistractifyYT brought on several doctors to react to the injuries in these movies several years ago, so props to them for the idea! In taking my crack at it, I discuss all sorts of traumatic injuries suffered by Harry and Marv, such as concussions, burns, testicular torsion, slips, falls, and the all-too-common holiday injury of an iron smashing your face. Oh, and nails in your foot. And bricks hitting your skull! Ouch… enjoy!I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.

Boris Johnson made the announcement after scientists said a mutation of Covid-19 was spreading rapidly in London, the south east and east of England.The variant is said to be much more contagious, but doesn't appear to cause more serious illness.From midnight tonight, new Tier 4 restrictions come into force, affecting all current Tier 3 areas, in London, the South East and east of England. The public is being asked to stay at home and there will be no so called “Christmas bubbles” for gatherings.   Social get-togethers will be restricted to meeting one other person in an open public space. Non-essential shops will close, as well as gyms, beauty salons and hairdressers.For those living in Tiers 1 to 3 in England, “Christmas bubble” gatherings can now only take place on Christmas Day. The original plan was for 5 days.Meanwhile all of Wales is entering a new lockdown  with the restrictions only eased for Christmas Day, andScotland is also only relaxing its rules on Christmas Day, with the highest level of restrictions coming into force for the whole country on Boxing Day. Northern Ireland has already announced a new national lockdown from Boxing Day.Clive Myrie presents BBC News reporting by political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Alexandra Mackenzie in Glasgow, James Williams in Cardiff and medical editor Fergus Walsh.

I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Fixing and giving makeovers to squishies is such a fun painting project, and a great creative art activity. It's been keeping me busy for years 😂 Hopefully you like my creations this episode. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

The draconian bracket will see non-essential shops  shut, and travel restrictions including a 'stay at home' order for Christmas Day itself - even though Mr Johnson insisted just days ago that it would be 'inhuman' to axe five-day festive 'bubbles'. Christmas plans for millions of Londoners were thrown into doubt by the Prime Minister's announcement, with many planning on travelling out of the capital during the relaxation of coronavirus measures between December 23 and 27. But with the planned relaxation cancelled, and the new rules coming into force from midnight, people were tonight scrambling to get out of London while they still could.Original Article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9071155/Huge-queues-train-stations-desperate-Londoners-flee-capital-ahead-Tier-4.htmlOriginal Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/coronaviruslockdowns/video-2317042/Video-Couple-reacts-Tier-4-update-Christmas-plans-cancelled.htmlDaily Mail Facebook: http://facebook.com/dailymailDaily Mail IG: http://instagram.com/dailymailDaily Mail Snap: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Daily-Mail/8392137033Daily Mail Twitter: http://twitter.com/MailOnlineDaily Mail Pinterest: http://pinterest.co.uk/dailymailDaily Mail Google+: https://plus.google.com/+DailyMailGet the free Daily Mail mobile app: http://dailymail.co.uk/mobile","1M36S"

On the face of it, you might think the RS6 has the Model 3 beat. With a 4-litre twin-turbo packed under the bonnet, this monstrous estate can put down 600hp & 800Nm! These stats are easily well above the  490hp & 660Nm the Tesla’s two electric motors can produce. However, we’re sure you’ll all know that Tesla has a LOT of history when it comes to carwow drag races, and we all know just how quickly it can put down its power. But is the gulf in performance just too much this time around?

In War On Drugs, we examine the social implications of prohibition worldwide. Any attempt to shut down the trade in drugs such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine or weed invariably sets off a chain of events that just makes things worse, leaving a trail of death, illness, violence, slavery, addiction, crime and inequality across the globe. Everyone loses – except, in a weird kind of way, the drugs themselves.
