On this occasion, they will hold a Moonlight festival at [12:00], when the moon shines the brightest‚Äîa festival where no girl will feel silenced.LOOŒ†Œî makes coincidence when destiny collides with fate, and finds her destiny within coincidence and fate to deliver a new message for the Midnight Festival.  ‚ÄòWith all LOOŒ†Œîs around the world‚Äô, all of the LOOŒ†Œîs across the globe will always be together, where all are dignified, equal and worthy of freedom. The united voices of the girls around the world rings loud and clear ahead of the start of the new moon. Intro for the album which is ‚Äô12:00‚Äô, it is promised time in the new space, capturing our story of getting into orbit.The titled track ‚ÄòWhy Not?‚Äô is an uptempo electronic pop song, with a story of pursuing freedom and individualistic self. The funky and bubbly bass line reminiscent of the Midnight Festival is impressive. The key change in the song, which started with a charismatic introduction, from the chorus to the witty major, it resembles LOOŒ†Œî who is about to change. ‚ÄòVoice‚Äô is an energetic retro song with a low, repetitive beat that evokes addiction. It is meant to enjoy the feelings of love and to venture together in an uncontrollable excitement. ‚ÄòFall Again‚Äô has a story about falling back in love with the one every time fall returns. It is a Pop R&B, a harmonious blend of sentimental vocals and rhythmic instruments by LOOŒ†Œî. It gives the feeling of the seasonality of autumn abundant.  ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô is a dreamy up-tempo electronic pop ballad with soft sweltering pads, ambient vocals and steady beat, adding warmth to the beat of love, attraction and temptation with the piano melody, allowing you to feel the song in its entirety.  ‚ÄòHide & Seek‚Äô is a cool, bright, poptastic uptempo dance song, which it coolly reveals one‚Äôs mind that is not hidden. It is showing confidence to the opponent, like playing hide & seek.  ‚ÄòOOPS!‚Äô is a multi-groove pop song characterized by a cool, repetitive feeling and Latin undertones. It sends a message that the one will love oneself and live freely without caring about others anymore.

But the royal existence isn't always a fairy tale, and this prince has seen his fair share of hardship and heartbreak. These are some of the tragic details about Prince William.Prince William's parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, went through a very messy, very public divorce - which was also incredibly prolonged. Charles and Diana first announced their separation in 1992, when William was just ten years old. Given their popular union and the royal family's historically fraught relationship with divorce, however, it was several years before they made the split official.Even after announcing their separation, the Prince of Wales and the People's Princess continued to carry out their royal duties, according to the History Channel. However, their already-strained relationship continued to deteriorate, with much of the drama playing out in the public eye. In November 1995, when a 13-year-old Prince William was attending boarding school, his mother gave an explosive, tell-all interview about her marriage. Airing on BBC One's Panorama, one of the most memorable moments came when Diana was asked if Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' then-alleged mistress and now-wife, played a role in the breakdown of the union. She famously replied,Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.According to royal biographer Katie Nicholl, William was reportedly mortified by this deeply personal interview - not only had his peers watched, but he was hounded by the paparazzi.Eventually, Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, urged the two to formally divorce, which they did in August 1996. Divorce isn't easy for any child, but for William, the very public breakdown of his parents' marriage was reportedly extra traumatic.

That came in the form of The Hobbit trilogy, starring Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. The only problem? While The Lord of the Rings trilogy was based on a trilogy of books, The Hobbit trilogy was based off a single one. So yeah-- there‚Äôs a lot of filler.The Desolation of Smaug definitely raises some questions. Like why do these dwarves keep getting captured every few minutes? Is Bilbo really going to have to use the ring every time to help them escape? Why does he keep removing it in key action scenes? Why is Legolas here? How did they think they‚Äôd be able to take down a dragon using heat? Why does this movie just kind of end?To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug!

I think I got it all out of my system for the time being. Today, we attempt to jump a mountain bike and RC car over a tabletop at the same time. It turns out that this isn't nearly as easy as sending the car or bike alone, as they actually travel at different speeds to clear the same jump. After some technical problems and a steep learning curve, we finally figure out that a bigger battery makes it much easier to time. Here's the car Traxxas sent ushttps://traxxas.com/products/landing/maxx/If you're interested in the Maxx, just go to your local hobby shop and they will probably have it. You'll also need a charger, battery, and probably some tools. This thing is an absolute beast! It might need a little polishing after landing upside down about 300 times.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show‚Äôs innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist‚Äôs voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Tamara Jade Performs Lizzo's Cuz I Love You and Gets a Four-Chair Turn - The Voice Blind Auditionshttps://youtu.be/_HW9zvEIvVEThe Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","5M20S"

When building a tiny house, the more time that you can spend in the design phase, the more likely you are to create a home that will truly meet your needs and that‚Äôs exactly the case with this incredible tiny house on wheels which has some absolutely unique, never before seen features! Lilah and Ollie spent a lot of time researching and traveling around New Zealand, staying in as many different tiny homes as possible to get ideas for their own dream tiny house. They drew out sketches, chalked out designs on their driveway and even went online to create 3D models of their home to make sure that they got the design right. The end result is a wonderful, modern and spacious tiny house filled with unique features such as a bump out in the roof to create additional standing room in the sleeping loft, a brilliant open plan kitchen / living room with island and even a bath tub hidden under the deck! Enjoy the full video tour of this very clever and unique tiny house on wheels.

Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and his diverse, lovable colleagues as they police the NYPD's 99th Precinct. After Capt. Raymond Holt's (Andre Braugher) demotion to patrolman at the end of Season 6, the squad's world is turned upside down. Rounding out the ensemble is the newly promoted Lt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews). Reporting to him is Sgt. Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), a consummate rule-follower with a weak spot for dork dancing and her husband, Jake. The other detectives in the squad include Jake's best friend, Det. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), and the tough-as-nails Det. Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). Also part of the Nine-Nine are veteran officers Det. Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) and Det. Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker), whose only skill as police officers is their ability to make a passable pot of coffee.Brooklyn Nine-Nine is available now on Peacock, the new streaming service from NBCUniversal.
