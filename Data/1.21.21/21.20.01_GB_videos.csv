So i sent them a wire transfer! A lot of people always say their parents were unsupportive or never believed in them but mine were the complete opposite! My parents always believed in me and supported my decision to drop out of university and pursue youtube full time. Having their support made things so much easier and i seriously cant thank them enough. Thanks to everyone who supports us for helping me make one of my dreams come true.

The album is orchestrated with three different chapters that encompass different themes and various musical colors for each track. Each album Chapter has its own main single, and is broken down into 3 segments.Just as light can refract and unfold delicately into a beautiful spectrum, these singles each represent a crucial sliver of the whole spectrum of CHUNG HA.The album concludes with producer BlackSkirt’s own interpretation of ‘CHUNG HA’s life. Now is the time to place the third and final piece of the puzzle.청하가 “X”로 첫 정규 앨범의 세 번째 조각을 건넨다. 다가오는 앨범은 트랙마다 각기 다른 음악적 색채와 주제로 세공한 챕터로 구성되어 있다. 모든 챕터는 이를 대표하는 타이틀곡이 존재하고, 순차적으로 하나씩 싱글 컷 될 예정이다.빛이 굴절되어 섬세하게 펼쳐지며 아름다운 스펙트럼을 이루듯, 음악의 조각들이 하나씩 더해지며 깊이 있게 “청하”를 그려갈 예정이다.다양한 색을 선보이며 챕터의 마지막에 도착, 이번에는 검정치마가 해석한 “청하”의 삶의 한 페이지이다. 이제 그녀가 건네는 음악의 세 번째 조각을 설레는 마음으로 맞춰 볼 시간이다.[CHUNG HA 'X' Credits]Lyrics by DJ HotBoyzZ (BlackSkirt, Cliff Lin)Composed by DJ HotBoyzZ (BlackSkirt, Cliff Lin)Arranged by DJ HotBoyzZ (BlackSkirt, Cliff Lin))Synthesizers by DJ HotBoyzZ (BlackSkirt, Cliff Lin)Guitars by Cliff LinBackground Vocals by BlackSkirtRecording Engineer Jung Eunkyeng, Kim Su Jung at Ingrid StudioMixing Engineer Cliff Lin at The Helm Studio TNMastering Engineer Park Jung-Un at Honey Butter StudioCHUNG HA Pre 'X' Official MV CreditsProduction : FANTAZY LABDirector : DEE SHIN, KIM ZI YONGAsst.Director : KIM BO HYEONGDirector of Photography: PARK SANGYUGaffer : YANG BYEONG JINCG/VFX : WETExecutive Producer : LEE JOO SEOBMusic Producer : VINCENZOCreative Director : VARK SUNG JINMedia Promotion Management : LEE JUNG WOOVisual Production : LEE SE RIN, PARK MI RAE, YOO MIN JI, KIM KI BAEArtist Development : LEE CHAE AFinancial Management : KO SU BINAdvertising Promotion Director : OH JI HO[ ARTIST DIVISION 1 ]Artist Manager : KWON JUN MO, YOO HA YOUNGProject Manager : HWANG MI AEMarketing : HWANG MI AE[ ARTIST DIVISION 2 ]Artist Manager : KWON JUN MO, LEE HYE JI, LEE JAE YEONProject Manager : BANG DA EUNMarketing : BANG DA EUN, LIM DA EUNStylist : PARK SU KYUNGHair & Make-up : KIM EUN JIN (Assist.

But, if 2020 taught us anything it was to embrace change so with that spirit we are looking forward to all of the many blessings, lessons and love that 2021 has in store for us all. This week Eamon's does something we NEVER thought we'd see (remember that whole embracing chane thing?). Yeah, he chops off ALL his hair! Or does he 🤔 ?. We also take you out onto our frozen lake to enjoy a very Canadian sport of ice skating! Plus, there's the never-ending renovations projects inside the cabin and a healthy dose of laughter.

We've always envisioned moving into the woods by the lake and building our dream tiny cabin as a home base for us to come back to in between our international travels. We cannot wait to have a place to call our own!! Our goal here is to inspire you to chase after your own dreams!

A former 3 x world karate champion and West End child star-turned-9 x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. The singer and co-writer behind a swarm of hit records - ‘Alarm’, ‘Ciao Adios’, ‘Rockabye’, ‘FRIENDS’ and ‘2002’ - Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’, in 2018, subsequently ending that year as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist: her debut has now sold over two million copies, globally, and a quarter of a million in her home market [the album has earned 1 x Diamond, 8 x Platinum and 7 x Gold certifications worldwide]. Throw in sold out headline shows and stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran, 2020 is Anne-Marie’s for the taking.","3M15S"

We've got Mat in 'his' Audi RS6, going up against Yianni's Lamborghini Urus! When it comes to performance stats, both of these are easily drag race ready. The Audi's packing a 4-litre twin-turbo with the ability to put down 600hp & 800Nm of torque! As you might expect though, it's pretty heavy, weighing in at 2,075kg. As for Yianni's Urus? Well under the bonnet you'll find the exact same 4-litre twin-turbo V8 as in the RS6, however it's been tuned to deliver 650hp & 850Nm! It does weigh a bit more though, coming in at 2,199kg. So how do you think this one will play out? We all know Yianni's the king of reaction times (sorry Mat 😬) but will the extra weight work against him?! There's only one way to find out...

Constance's lovely channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ClFJYwA3lDagY4igPKddg Labor ethics disclaimer from the brand which the corset was purchased: https://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/people/factory-workers/Despite this disclaimer, however, I was unable to find satisfactory evidence to prove that the brand have established contractual requirements with their manufacturers to ensure that the factories commissioned to manufacture products are paying their employees at living wages. Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that this brand is one of the many guilty of cancelling partly- or fully-completed orders this year without paying manufacturers for labor performed. For this reason, I do not endorse this brand and I do consider this purchase to be in violation of my anti-fast fashion endeavors. Though I won’t be returning the item, as that doesn’t do anything productive, I will upcycle it into something I can use—and intend to give the purchase of this garment a net-positive outcome by donating the ad revenue from this video to the Clean Clothes Campaign (https://cleanclothes.org/about), an organisation which is dedicated to improving garment worker rights and conditions worldwide. https://goodonyou.eco/adidas-ethical/2019 report on brands and ethical labor policies/future plans: https://labourbehindthelabel.org/report-tailored-wages-uk-2019/https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/adidas-agSOURCES & FOOTNOTES:Due to character limitations, the full page of footnotes can be found here: https://bernadettebanner.co.uk/sports-corsetsGartland, Elizabeth.

When the Girls Came Out to Play: The Birth of American Sportswear. Massachusetts, University of Massachusetts Press, August 2, 2006.*I actually disagree with this; I mean, yes, it *could* probably be worn over another corset, but the advertisement declares that this corselet 'supersedes the corset' and highlights its intention to be worn only on the upper part of the body, allowing for perfect freedom of movement in the lower. I think they've drawn this conclusion because of the strange little buttoned tabs coming out the bottom of it, but the advertisement shows the woman using these tabs to button the waist of her skirt in place. Since the Khiva corselet is very short in length, it wouldn't provide that secure anchor point at the waist that normal, bust-to-hip corsets do.

After each death, the crew has an opportunity to vote one member off the ship, launching them into space to perish in hopes of getting rid of the Impostor.

Up top we're gonna be dropping some big fan theories and then we'll continue with our more traditional breakdown but it's all gonna be time coded in the description below.Now the last time we saw Vision he was giving a piece of his mind to Thanos and Wanda was moping around after the Avengers saved the universe. Cheer up love it's a funeral.Now the series itself picks up with us having very little idea over what it is that's exactly going on and why the character are in this strange 1950s sitcom world.Now in death Vision actually turned grey and this was very similar to his silver costume in the comics that became a big part of the character. Though we know from the trailers that that won't remain I love the black and white aesthetic here that sort of ties into that Easter Egg and who knows he may turn back to being grey at some point.As for Wanda she has clearly created this pocket dimension and though we don't know exactly what's going on just yet there was a big clue in one of the tv spots that was recently released. Now I just wanna give a huge shoutouts to @kwistatz on twitter for sending me this through and the trailer ends like most do with a voice over announcing when it's coming out. However instead of saying streaming friday it sounds like he says dreaming friday and when you turn on closed captions you can see that this is indeed the case.-This mistake seems deliberate and to me it's hinting that Wanda is actually dreaming this entire reality and due to her powers it may have manifested. This could mean that the character is actually asleep at the centre of it all and the reality is building up around her.The characters that we see could have been sucked into this and this is why they are unable to remember what's going on outside of their reality. The people that we see the pair interact with could be doctors or psychologists on the outside trying to help her with her grief and they've become trapped in the dimension unable to escape from it.Visions Tie also could be hinting at people being enclosed in something and from what we see it has a rectangle with two dots inside of it. These two dots could represent both Wanda and Vision who are trapped inside this box that the former has dreamt up.► Artist AttributionLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16PgrLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgAArtwork @mb0sco","16M44S"

A former 3 x world karate champion and West End child star-turned-9 x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. The singer and co-writer behind a swarm of hit records - ‘Alarm’, ‘Ciao Adios’, ‘Rockabye’, ‘FRIENDS’ and ‘2002’ - Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’, in 2018, subsequently ending that year as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist: her debut has now sold over two million copies, globally, and a quarter of a million in her home market [the album has earned 1 x Diamond, 8 x Platinum and 7 x Gold certifications worldwide]. Throw in sold out headline shows and stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran, 2020 is Anne-Marie’s for the taking.","3M9S"
