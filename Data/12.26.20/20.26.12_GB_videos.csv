This video is meant to refute these claims. I encourage everyone to watch until the end, especially if they watched the original video.In this video we hear from a statistical expert with a PhD that wrote a 19 page analysis on what the mods did wrong. I also disprove some of the claims made in the original video. All relevant information should be viewable below.Although I would have loved to attempt to refute the math myself, I suck at math and would have looked like a complete idiot.

We’ve got the AMG A45 S going up against its baby brother, the AMG A35!Now before you leave a negative comment on the video, we know what you’re thinking - the result is, of course, a foregone conclusion. Although both cars are packing 2-litre turbocharged petrol engines, their performances are actually quite different. The A35 will produce 306hp and 400Nm, while the A45 S’s hand-built engine puts down 421hp and 500Nm! However, there’s one key stat where the A35 wins - the price! Coming in £13,000 lower, the A35 is easily one of the best value mid-range hot hatches out there. The question is, should you splash out on the A45 S, or are you going to get enough performance from the A35 that you should just save yourself £13,000?There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!.............................................................Instagram – http://www.instagram.com/carwowTiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@carwowFacebook – http://www.facebook.com/carwowukTwitter – http://www.twitter.com/carwowukAwkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.

France closed the border on Sunday due to growing concern about a new variant strain of coronavirus spreading across the UK.

Coming to theaters and streaming exclusively on HBO Max on January 29. #TheLittleThingsMovieAcademy Award winners Denzel Washington (“Training Day,” “Glory”), Rami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”) and Jared Leto (“Dallas Buyers Club”) star in the psychological thriller “The Little Things.” John Lee Hancock (“The Blind Side,” “Saving Mr. Banks,” “The Founder”) directed the film from his own original screenplay.Kern County Deputy Sheriff Joe “Deke” Deacon (Washington) is sent to Los Angeles for what should have been a quick evidence-gathering assignment. Instead, he becomes embroiled in the search for a killer who is terrorizing the city. Leading the hunt, L.A. Sheriff Department Sergeant Jim Baxter (Malek), impressed with Deke’s cop instincts, unofficially engages his help. But as they track the killer, Baxter is unaware that the investigation is dredging up echoes of Deke’s past, uncovering disturbing secrets that could threaten more than his case.The main cast also includes Natalie Morales (“Battle of the Sexes”), Terry Kinney (“Mile 22,” TV’s “Billions”), Chris Bauer (“Sully,” TV’s “The Deuce”), Joris Jarsky (TV’s “Bad Blood”), Isabel Arraiza (TV’s “Pearson”) and Michael Hyatt (“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”).“The Little Things” is produced by Oscar- and Emmy-winning producer Mark Johnson (“Breaking Bad,” “Rain Man”) and Hancock, with Mike Drake and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers.Behind the scenes, Hancock reunited with several longtime collaborators, including Oscar-nominated director of photography John Schwartzman (“Seabiscuit,” “The Founder,” “Saving Mr. Banks”), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (“Apollo 13,” “The Founder,” “The Blind Side”) editor Robert Frazen (“The Founder”), and costume designer Daniel Orlandi (“The Founder,” “The Blind Side”). The music is by multiple Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (“1917,” “Bridge of Spies,” “Saving Mr. Banks”).Warner Bros. Pictures presents A Gran Via Production, “The Little Things” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.

Unlike conventional airplanes, tail sitting planes rested on their tails and used engine power alone to lift off the ground before transitioning to vertical flight, and returning to land vertically once again on their tail. The configuration, although technically challenging to develop, would allow aircraft to operate without runways, fundamentally changing how and where air forces could use their aircraft. In the early 1950s French aerospace firm SNECMA (Société nationale d'études et de construction de moteurs d'aviation) began developing wingless test rigs to prove the viability of the tail sitting concept. At the time, American firms were also developing tail sitting prototypes of their own, But SNECMA would take it a step further by developing a tail sitting aircraft with a highly unconventional annular (cylindrical) wing. The cylindrical wing promised greater efficiency over a conventional wing by eliminating wing-tip vortices. It would also be more compact, further reducing the space needed for vertical take-off and landings. French designers also theorised that a cylindrical wing could eventually be engineered to function as a ramjet engine, propelling the aircraft to supersonic speeds.The C.450 Coleoptere was constructed in 1958, with tethered flight testing beginning in early 1959. By May, the unconventional plane had achieved its first successful unassisted hover, even reaching altitudes of 800 meters. Despite early successes during flight tests, flaws soon emerged in the aircraft’s design. The Coleoptere proved extremely difficult to pilot. An innovative pilot seat could swivel 90 degrees, but pilots still struggled to judge the aircraft’s distance from the ground while landing. Without a conventional wing to provide resistance, the Coleoptere also had a tendency to slowly spin on its axis. On July 25, 1959, the Coleoptere performed it’s 9th test flight. This time, the pilot was to transition the aircraft from vertical to horizontal flight, a challenging procedure that would mark a huge milestone for the program. The Coleoptere lifted off successfully, but during its transition, it suddenly became too inclined and slow-moving to maintain altitude. The aircraft started tumbling back to earth as the pilot struggled to regain control, barely managing to eject at the very last minute. The Coleoptere was destroyed.A second prototype of the Coleoptere would never be built. By the 1960’s it was clear that the tail sitting configuration was a dead-end. It was simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload and range, and far too difficult to pilot. It was clear that vectoring thrust, allowing the aircraft to remain horizontal, was a more practical and safer solution.

This “Great Conjunction” happens next on December 21, 2020, but this time, Jupiter and Saturn will be closer than they’ve been in nearly 400 years.  December 21 also happens to be the night of the winter solstice, and the peak of the Ursid meteor shower. For most Great Conjunctions, Jupiter and Saturn are separated by about 1 degree, which is the width of two full moons in the sky. This year, they will be separated by just one-tenth of a degree, which is one-fifth the size of the full moon. A Great Conjunction happens every 20 years, but the last time Jupiter and Saturn were this close was the year 1623.Join Lowell Observatory at 5pm MST on Monday, December 21, 2020, to celebrate the Great Conjunction with an evening of telescope viewing and commentary from Lowell's own astronomers and educators.#ChristmasStar","2H32M10S"

This close approach of the two planets is called a great conjunction and occurs when the independent movements of Jupiter and Saturn make them appear close together in the sky. This happens once every 20 years, but they have not been seen this close together since 1226 A.D.If we have clear skies, this conjunction may be seen in the southwestern sky shortly after dark on December 21, and it should be visible from roughly 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Jupiter and Saturn will be very close together. Anyone will be able to see the pair with unaided eyes. No telescope or binoculars is required, but a magnified view through a Griffith Observatory telescope will be live streamed. You can also observe both planets and their moons through your own telescope.LIVE WEBCAST: Griffith Observatory will start streaming the winter solstice great conjunction to our YouTube page on Monday, December 21, 2020, at 4:30 p.m., PST. The program will begin with a live view of the sunset, which occurs at 4:48 p.m., PST. A telescopic view of Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction will be streamed live as soon as acquired, in the twilight, perhaps by 5:00 p.m., PST.","2H29M24S"

Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria and Italy have all announced restrictions, including bans on flights and trains from the UK. France and Germany are said to be considering similar action. This comes after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced tougher measures to combat the new virus strain. Officials say while the new mutation is much more easily transmitted, it's not thought to be any more dangerous.Concern about the new strain has led British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reverse plans to ease coronavirus restrictions over the Christmas period. He has imposed an effective lockdown on London and southeast England. The move has made the capital - usually bustling with shoppers at this time of year - almost unrecognizable. Millions of people have been forced to cancel their Christmas plans under the new restrictions. The Prime Minister is facing widespread criticism for the decision. However Britain's health secretary says the government had to take quick action.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnewsFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#NewStrain #Coronavirus #Pandemic","7M1S"
