This video is a different rendition of it, where there are FOUR hunters instead of just one.This is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend BadBoyHalo AND my friend Antfrost tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.If this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do something else.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin#MinecraftManhunt","49M48S"

His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’. #EdSheeran #Afterglow #Lyric","3M6S"

Primero, no quería que pensaran que de una situación tan difícil estaba sacando provecho y, de igual forma, en ese entonces mi condición física no era la mejor pues había aumentado casi 50 libras. Hoy, varios meses después seguimos viviendo en la pandemia y, aunque quisiéramos pensarlo así, nada ha cambiado. No era mi mejor momento ni el de muchos, por eso hoy les presento “CORONA” para que juntos reflexionemos sobre lo que verdaderamente importa: estar vivos, tener salud y agradecer lo que tenemos. Yo, dejé que mi condición física me detuviera en ese momento pero con este video dejo eso atrás y entendí que el cambio llega cuando así tú lo decides. ¡Disfruten “CORONA” con la esperanza de que este capítulo de nuestras vidas se cierre muy pronto!Suscríbete al canal: https://goo.gl/yypZyaMás vídeos de DY: De Vuelta Pa' La  Vuelta: https://youtu.be/VibGLc41UvQCon Calma: https://youtu.be/DiItGE3eAyQQue Tire Pa' 'Lante: https://youtu.be/fAgvmh1jaCESigue a DY:Facebook-http://goo.gl/QYZ53a | Twitter-http://goo.gl/AzaR8o Instagram-http://goo.gl/a6F7gz | www.daddyyankee.comLetra:👑 CORONA 👑 Tamo’ preso en la libre sin cumplir una CONDENAUna máscara vale más que una CADENAAlguien dijo la vida es BUENA, aunque la nevera no esté LLENA el Señor nos acompaña en la última CENA Amén!Nuestro afán no se LIMITASeguimos pensando en likes cuando alguienun corazón NECESITALa muerte llega sin CITASubimos videos cuando hay gente que no pueden recibir VISITAS Una hija duerme con su madre muerta en su CASAno hay hueco pa’ tanto muerto un saludo es una AMENAZAtiempos donde la MENTIRA es verdad y la verdad se hace MENTIRALo que es real es que la tierra RESPIRA de su depredador y tamo’ sintiendo su IRATodo el mal que hemos sembrado como un chota se nos VIRAAunque esto ha sido PREMEDITADO, ESTUDIADO y PLANIFICADOquien hubiera PENSADOQue sin tener cadenas estamos ENCADENADOSLos animales libres y nosotros ENCERRADOS Malditos gobiernos son una PLAGAEn esta guerra biológica el civil es quien PAGAEn TEORÍA sin ejército hay una guerra FRÍADonde al final del DÍA una potencia quiere liderar la ECONOMÍA Soy culpable porque veo al INDEFENSO Y me hago el CIEGO no soy mudo pero callo lo que PIENSO Hacía falta una vacuna de humildad pal’ corazón ALTIVOQue ironía que la tierra en pausa yo me siento más VIVO menos redes más ESCRIBO me DESCRIBO como el mejor reggaetonero y rapero  VIVO (bendecido) 🙏🏽Hace tiempo no le daba las gracias a Dios por mi SALUD hey! hey! hey!Gracias que no han venido los negritos a llevarme en un ATAÚD, hey! hey! hey!

This video is meant to refute these claims. I encourage everyone to watch until the end, especially if they watched the original video.In this video we hear from a statistical expert with a PhD that wrote a 19 page analysis on what the mods did wrong. I also disprove some of the claims made in the original video. All relevant information should be viewable below.Although I would have loved to attempt to refute the math myself, I suck at math and would have looked like a complete idiot.

The fully-equipped production studio on the lower levels of the building are a familiar background to viewers but it’s in the residence above where the design work truly shines. A magnificent kitchen to match his culinary skills, bright sunlit rooms and a backyard to grill and smoke to his heart’s content all add up to a pad perfectly tailored to Babish. Check out Andrew Rea's newly rebranded channel, Babish Culinary Universe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJHA_jMfCvEnv-3kRjTCQXw.And his signature product line with Gibson USA will be available Feb 1!

The Twin Cities and other parts of Minnesota are slow to recover as this morning's icy roads, including black ice, have caused travel to become very hazardous including semi truckers and other motorious becoming stuck on 694 West north of Little, Canada, MN due to not being able to get up a certain part of the highway due to the roads being so icy. This lead to traffic being blocked for (according to google maps and the 511 Minnesota app) 7+ miles. I personally was in dead-end traffic for 30 or more minutes. Other parts of the cities are digging out of the snow and ice, as most are hoping to get some last-minute shopping done and or visit family.Videos Include a few voice overs of me making a few comments about the black ice on the 4th and 3rd videos from the end.

I did one where all I added was maple syrup and that was interesting although you can barely taste the maple over the powdered sugar, but what I learned from this is holy cow does corn syrup ever taste good. As an adult I've been in this mentality that corn syrup is the worst and why would you ever eat that and I tasted it for the first time in years and it was like eating caramel for the first time. I think I chugged that stuff when I was a kid and wanted candy because it's liquid candy. Anyway, what I'm saying is I recommend corn syrup. Even though it comes from corn, which is not recommended.","5M51S"

With COVID-19 cases rising dramatically, Ford says his government needs a runway to rollout the COVID-19 vaccine. The stay-at-home order will be in place for 28 days in southern Ontario and 14 days in northern Ontario.Many businesses throughout the province will be faced with restrictions throughout the shutdown, including restaurants and bars which will once again be limited to only take out and delivery operations.Ford also said that while schools are not part of the problem, out of an abundance of caution, students from kindergarten to grade eight will return in-class on Jan. 11, while high school students will resume classes with remote learning on Jan. 11, returning to in-class instruction on Jan. 25.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7535230/ontario-new-coronavirus-shutdown-boxing-day/ Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#coronavirus #COVID19 #Ontario #GlobalNews #onpoli #onnews","44M41S"

The Impostor (who looks identical to the other players) kills off the crew members one-by-one.  After each death, the crew has an opportunity to vote one member off the ship, launching them into space to perish in hopes of getting rid of the Impostor.

This “Great Conjunction” happens next on December 21, 2020, but this time, Jupiter and Saturn will be closer than they’ve been in nearly 400 years.  December 21 also happens to be the night of the winter solstice, and the peak of the Ursid meteor shower. For most Great Conjunctions, Jupiter and Saturn are separated by about 1 degree, which is the width of two full moons in the sky. This year, they will be separated by just one-tenth of a degree, which is one-fifth the size of the full moon. A Great Conjunction happens every 20 years, but the last time Jupiter and Saturn were this close was the year 1623.Join Lowell Observatory at 5pm MST on Monday, December 21, 2020, to celebrate the Great Conjunction with an evening of telescope viewing and commentary from Lowell's own astronomers and educators.#ChristmasStar","2H32M10S"

Coming to theaters and streaming exclusively on HBO Max on January 29. #TheLittleThingsMovieAcademy Award winners Denzel Washington (“Training Day,” “Glory”), Rami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”) and Jared Leto (“Dallas Buyers Club”) star in the psychological thriller “The Little Things.” John Lee Hancock (“The Blind Side,” “Saving Mr. Banks,” “The Founder”) directed the film from his own original screenplay.Kern County Deputy Sheriff Joe “Deke” Deacon (Washington) is sent to Los Angeles for what should have been a quick evidence-gathering assignment. Instead, he becomes embroiled in the search for a killer who is terrorizing the city. Leading the hunt, L.A. Sheriff Department Sergeant Jim Baxter (Malek), impressed with Deke’s cop instincts, unofficially engages his help. But as they track the killer, Baxter is unaware that the investigation is dredging up echoes of Deke’s past, uncovering disturbing secrets that could threaten more than his case.The main cast also includes Natalie Morales (“Battle of the Sexes”), Terry Kinney (“Mile 22,” TV’s “Billions”), Chris Bauer (“Sully,” TV’s “The Deuce”), Joris Jarsky (TV’s “Bad Blood”), Isabel Arraiza (TV’s “Pearson”) and Michael Hyatt (“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”).“The Little Things” is produced by Oscar- and Emmy-winning producer Mark Johnson (“Breaking Bad,” “Rain Man”) and Hancock, with Mike Drake and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers.Behind the scenes, Hancock reunited with several longtime collaborators, including Oscar-nominated director of photography John Schwartzman (“Seabiscuit,” “The Founder,” “Saving Mr. Banks”), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (“Apollo 13,” “The Founder,” “The Blind Side”) editor Robert Frazen (“The Founder”), and costume designer Daniel Orlandi (“The Founder,” “The Blind Side”). The music is by multiple Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (“1917,” “Bridge of Spies,” “Saving Mr. Banks”).Warner Bros. Pictures presents A Gran Via Production, “The Little Things” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film has slated for release on January 29, 2021 in theaters and on HBO Max and has been rated R for violent/disturbing images, language and full nudity.","2M25S"

Unlike conventional airplanes, tail sitting planes rested on their tails and used engine power alone to lift off the ground before transitioning to vertical flight, and returning to land vertically once again on their tail. The configuration, although technically challenging to develop, would allow aircraft to operate without runways, fundamentally changing how and where air forces could use their aircraft. In the early 1950s French aerospace firm SNECMA (Société nationale d'études et de construction de moteurs d'aviation) began developing wingless test rigs to prove the viability of the tail sitting concept. At the time, American firms were also developing tail sitting prototypes of their own, But SNECMA would take it a step further by developing a tail sitting aircraft with a highly unconventional annular (cylindrical) wing. The cylindrical wing promised greater efficiency over a conventional wing by eliminating wing-tip vortices. It would also be more compact, further reducing the space needed for vertical take-off and landings. French designers also theorised that a cylindrical wing could eventually be engineered to function as a ramjet engine, propelling the aircraft to supersonic speeds.The C.450 Coleoptere was constructed in 1958, with tethered flight testing beginning in early 1959. By May, the unconventional plane had achieved its first successful unassisted hover, even reaching altitudes of 800 meters. Despite early successes during flight tests, flaws soon emerged in the aircraft’s design. The Coleoptere proved extremely difficult to pilot. An innovative pilot seat could swivel 90 degrees, but pilots still struggled to judge the aircraft’s distance from the ground while landing. Without a conventional wing to provide resistance, the Coleoptere also had a tendency to slowly spin on its axis. On July 25, 1959, the Coleoptere performed it’s 9th test flight. This time, the pilot was to transition the aircraft from vertical to horizontal flight, a challenging procedure that would mark a huge milestone for the program. The Coleoptere lifted off successfully, but during its transition, it suddenly became too inclined and slow-moving to maintain altitude. The aircraft started tumbling back to earth as the pilot struggled to regain control, barely managing to eject at the very last minute. The Coleoptere was destroyed.A second prototype of the Coleoptere would never be built. By the 1960’s it was clear that the tail sitting configuration was a dead-end. It was simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload and range, and far too difficult to pilot. It was clear that vectoring thrust, allowing the aircraft to remain horizontal, was a more practical and safer solution.

The Port of Dover has temporarily been closed. New restrictions have come into force for 18 million people in England and 3 million people in Wales. In England areas within the new Tier 4 rules include London, Kent and most of Essex.  People have been told to stay home with  non-essential shops closed.   Christmas mixing of households will not be permitted. The festive rules have changed in the rest of England too - with a gathering only now allowed on Christmas Day.Mishal Husain presents BBC News at Ten reporting by political correspondent Nick Eardley, transport correspondent Caroline Davies, business editor Simon Jack and health correspondent Catherine Burns.

My friend has found it on the steel waste together with the german „Weltrekord“ ratchet screwdriver. The condition of the drill was super bad. It was very corroded, had a lot of missing screws, the handle was in very bad condition and the crank was bent so much you couldn't even make a full turn. That's all said, it was the perfect item for a new restoration video.At first I thought this should be a quick and easy project, but one problem after the other became visible and it turned out to be a real challenge. There was the big dent in the left side of the case. Usually you can't bend casted parts, but with a bit of heat and careful pressure on the arbor press I was able to remove it a bit. It also worked to get rid of the warping with some heat. For the finish of the housing I wanted to have an antique cast aluminium look. I thought it would look very cool if I could tumbler these parts after sandblasting. I ended up building a huge rotary tumbler from scratch and it worked very well (video link below).Another big issue was the tool holder and the drill bit, as they were both completly rusted. Big thanks to @Hand Tool Rescue  at this point for helping me out with the dimensions on these two parts by disassembling and measuring his own hammer drill. After a bit of search on eBay I found a set of original Rawlplug drill bits. After they arrived I was able to measure the shaft and the taper of the drill to then turn a new tool holder. It all worked out very well and yes, the drill only holds with the taper ;-)Before I even started this project I just had one question in mind „How am I going to replace the messed up handle cover?“. My first idea was to wrap it in nice black leather like steering wheels are made. That would definitely work, but that's something I've never done before so I was quite sceptical. Then the idea of a heat shrink tube came up. That would be a very easy solution, but heat shrink tubes don't have any structuires to it and it wouldn't quite fit the the rest of the tool. Thanks to the research of my Patreons and channel members, they have found very special heat shrink tubes that have a structure in it. I really liked it as it almost looked exactly the same like the original handle.After all it was a very intense and time consuming project. I've done so many hours of research on this one and I had to learn new skills. I'm very happy how it turned out.I hope you like my work and the video.Huge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and specially to:Tonya M BroermanZack ThompsonAdel AlSaffarafreeflyingsoulYale BakerGregoryAlex McGeorgeAlistair MoorAmar.kBendurionCourtney MaleportDavid BarkerGreg MarstonJoshua BentleyLambda GPU WorkstationsLuke SchmickLuke StoneMatt BoschMellissa MarcusMike SchlodderMonte GibbsMuzaffer AksoyNick HoustonPaul MampillypotokslowTodd MedburyVickie BlighVince ValentiXavier CarbelYuri ZapuchlakAaron QuanteAlex Bretonalex latzkoAllen FrankAmanda Taylor, EsqAndreas MimraAndrew PhillipsAnthony AdamsArni Bjorgvinssonaudi4444playerBlake TBrandon FitzwaterBrian NewtonCarloChad BryantChris SimondetGrok SenftenHaley McFaddenHarper KimHunter R.Jason KoiJason TarlovJeremy ColeJonas RichartzJordan Pagejustin f.Kelly ImgrundKurt GazowMarc CerisierMarius CostanMartin Rønnow KlarlundMellissa McConnellMichael BierMickey EisenhornMike DonaldsonNick CannonPasacal SchmikalPhilippSchultes ThomasScott MarshallSergei ShvartsmanSvenja KucklaThe CarlsonsTrevor KamTucker IfftWarren G Strand JrWilliam Wallace웅록 윤My camera:Panasonic HC-VX11If you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.
