This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.","9M38S"

It was left in a barn near Hershey Pennsylvania before its first wash in 44 years! You'd expect this to be a complete detailing disaster because it was left untouched for so long...but the paint was in good condition despite being covered in filth and disgusting grime. In this barn find, we use AMMO Frothe to remove the first layer of dust and dirt to ensure the rubber seals did not leak if we power washed. Once confident, we power washed the paint, then compounded and polished with a Rupes polisher during our paint restoration. The Datsun 280z has since won several awards at Zcon and more information can be found at www.350mile280z.com.ADD DETAILING SIMULATOR TO WISH LIST HERE:https://store.steampowered.com/app/1433570/Car_Detailing_Simulator/AMMO Paint Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-paint-regimen-kit/AMMO Interior Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-interiorregimen-kit/AMMO Wheel Regimen: http://www.ammonyc.com/shop/ammo-wheel-regimen-kit/For more how to car care videos & full product line: http://www.ammonyc.com Carpet Brush for hand drill: https://amzn.to/31F2PKLRapid Adhesive Remover: https://amzn.to/2WcuOjNMini Shampooer: https://amzn.to/2W7swlTHeadliner Adhesive: https://amzn.to/33Ts9OxWindow Squeegee: https://amzn.to/2BAcE1XInduction Heater: https://amzn.to/2N4YUBFFestool Vacuum: https://amzn.to/33PuKJkSteam Machine: https://www.ammonyc.com/shop/steam-machine/If you’re a car fanatic like me, click the link below to be notified of my latest AMMO videos, products, podcasts, website promo’s and to take our quick Detailing Survey!http://eepurl.com/dOZ6ybAMMO Formulas used in this video: https://www.ammonyc.com/Recommended products and tools approved by AMMO NYC: Megs D300 https://amzn.to/2BUnXSQFoam Applicator Pads https://amzn.to/2MVU7U6Foam Gun https://amzn.to/2PEgNubWheel Woolies https://amzn.to/32YhGBxTar Remover https://amzn.to/2pYK6gaTire Gel Applicator https://amzn.to/2MVcf0oFestool Vacuum https://amzn.to/31Vv6wNMilwaukee Fan https://amzn.to/2peO9VEMilwaukee Rapid Charge https://amzn.to/2Wp2UB7Festool Vacuum Crevice https://amzn.to/34benXDRupes Polisher 21 https://amzn.to/2NisKCQRupes Polisher 3-in. https://amzn.to/2Wnl9HjMegs Foam Polishing Disc 6 https://amzn.to/2PqILJDMegs Foam Cutting Disc 6 https://amzn.to/2MXPbOTRupes Bag https://amzn.to/2PulLcwPositector Paint Depth Gauge https://amzn.to/2JwqOpfMercury Spray Bottle https://amzn.to/2PrFRnNMasterblaster https://amzn.to/2C4Rt8FCR Spotless Water Filter https://amzn.to/31Y7DuWMegs MF finish 3 https://amzn.to/2N04UgpMegs MF finish 5 https://amzn.to/2Pulq9LMegs MF finish 6 https://amzn.to/2q1TO19Megs MF cutting 3 https://amzn.to/2BTDSAYMegs MF cutting 5 https://amzn.to/2Nju1tkMegs MF cutting 6 https://amzn.to/2q1TX4HBlack Wow https://amzn.to/2PtG4XHMegs M205 https://amzn.to/2JwrNprMegs M105 https://amzn.to/2Ps31dSRoboReel https://amzn.to/2Pud6qPSteam Machine VX5000 https://amzn.to/368WBGmElcometer Paint Depth https://amzn.to/2NkP52AScangrip I-view https://amzn.to/2BWIN3KScangrip D-Match 2 https://amzn.to/2q1VU1bGorilla Gloves https://amzn.to/36k2ZLgLong-handled Window Scrubber https://amzn.to/2JyxZgJLoew-Cornell Fine line painting pen https://amzn.to/2JMhPAzFight Tech Dust Mask https://amzn.to/34bPZVRCarpet Brushes https://amzn.to/2qQiWIxSubscribe to AMMO NYC for clean cars: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=AMMONYCdotcomFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AMMOnyc/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ammonyc/For more product info: http://www.ammonyc.com/AMMO NYC Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/user/AMMONYCdotcomIf this video was helpful, please give us a THUMBS UP!Disclaimer:Due to factors beyond the control of AMMO NYC, Larry Kosilla, and Make Rain Productions, we cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

Yes, it’s about a product, but the product just represents the tool I used to express myself through this journey of feeling NO MORE SHAME! So here it is, our new Naughty Nude Palette! Naughty Nude means so much to me & on so many levels. It’s more than just a palette… it’s personal sh*t!! It represents no more sexual shame and feeling liberated with my mind and body, and finally accepting and loving myself! Now, I can finally embrace who am; I feel powerful and free in ways I’ve never felt before and I hope you feel that power too, with the palette, or with makeup (or whatever) sets you free. You all deserve to be empowered!

Unfortunately for Gaethje, a good gameplan wasn't enough to beat a perfect fighter. Nurmagomedov scored a win with a second-round submission, unifying his lightweight title with Gaethje's interim championship.Gaethje said leading up to the fight that he just needed to land solid kicks to the legs of Nurmagomedov to take away the champ's wrestling game and open him up to the challenger's huge power punches. The kicks did land, and Nurmagomedov's legs did seem to be starting to show some damage, but it only takes one moment for Nurmagomedov to put an opponent in a bad position.After a second-round leg kick from Gaethje, Nurmagomedov drove through a takedown and quickly moved to mount. After locking in a triangle choke, Nurmagomedov rolled to his back and squeezed the choke while Gaethje tapped out. Gaethje's taps were missed by the referee, leaving the challenger unconscious on the canvas.Following the fight, Nurmagomedov announced his retirement, stating he didn't want to return to the Octagon without his father, who died following COVID-19-related complications earlier this year.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#UFC #UFC245 #Khabib #JustinGaethje #MMA #Nurmagomedov #khabibNurmagomedov #FigtIsland","20M59S"

As it has for all of us this global pandemic has flipped our world upside down.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. Halting our dream of driving around the world was a hard pill to swallow which is why we knew we needed a big project to keep our mind + body busy while social distancing back here in Toronto. Enter building an off-grid tiny house on wheels!! But after nearly 6 months, we realized that our dreams of continuing van life across North America in our new van build were not a current reality with the state of the world. So, we've found ourselves pursuing something we've dreamed of since we first got together 8 years ago... a cabin in the woods 😊 Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourWhat's in Our Camera Bag? https://www.eamonandbec.com/blogWho are we?We're Eamon and Bec, a Toronto-based couple who live full-time in our self converted Sprinter Van!!

Should it be?It’s easy to complain about overreliance on special effects, but for projects that require impossible-to-film environments or have incredibly expensive shots, how do you get the flexibility of green screens without the drawbacks?Charmaine Chan has worked on one of the possible answers. Vox's Phil Edwards spoke to her about her career and how it's at the forefront of a big technological shift. As a compositor for venerable effects house Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), she’s worked on films like The Last Jedi, assembling various digital elements into a beautiful, seamless image. Her job changed on The Mandalorian, one of the first shows to use ILM’s upgrade for the green screen: LED panels that used video game engine technology to place a realistic-looking world behind the actors.It was a huge improvement, because green screens actually have a lot of drawbacks. Removing the green screen is never as quick as visual effects artists would hope. It also casts green light upon the set and actors. Even substitutes for a green screen, like projecting an image onto a screen behind the actor, fail to dynamically respond to camera movements the way they would in the real world.ILM’s solution fixes a lot of those problems, and it also led to creative breakthroughs in which the old Hollywood order of a TV show or movie, in which VFX came last, was suddenly reversed. Now, artists like Charmaine are alongside actors, set designers, and other crew members during filming. That collaboration means that this technology doesn’t just eliminate a screen — it eliminates a creative barrier.Watch the above video to see how it happens.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show’s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist’s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named “The Voice” and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.Carter Rubin Is 14 and Delivers on Lewis Capaldi's Before You Go - The Voice Blind Auditions 2020https://youtu.be/wzG_Wx_g4AgThe Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice","6M2S"

Find the last dragon. Watch the new trailer for Raya and the Last Dragon, in theaters March 2021.Long ago, in the fantasy world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well. From directors Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada, co-directors Paul Briggs and John Ripa, producers Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho, and featuring the voices of Kelly Marie Tran as Raya and Awkwafina as the last dragon Sisu, Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Raya and the Last Dragon” opens in U.S. theaters on March 2021.Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/rayaandthelastdragonTwitter:  https://twitter.com/DisneyRayaInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/disneyraya/Hashtag: #DisneyRaya","2M3S"

How do we change that?What do you wish the presidential candidates would talk about? http://vox.com/ElectionVideosIn the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country’s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.This video is the seventh in our series on the 2020 election. We aren’t covering the horse race; instead, we want to explain the stakes of the election through the issues that matter most to you.

First off, here's a little life update; We filmed this back in September but didn't get time to edit and upload the video until now. Immediately after filming our trip to Rocky Mountain Raceweek 2.0 (which is not in the Rocky Mountains), we left town to film Roadkill and Faster With Finnegan and we still aren't done filming those shows so we are working on Finnegan's Garage edits in our spare time. Anyway, since September, a lot has happened. I've bought a new enclosed ramp truck, which you'll briefly see in this video, I've traded away the six-door Ford F650 for a '66 Chevy Suburban, which you'll also see in this video, too. We also had a small shift linkage issue in Blasphemi during Rocky Mountain Raceweek 2.0, which resulted in a major engine failure-again, it's in this video. With any luck we'll upload Part 2 of the video next week. In that video, you'll see the rest of the road trip and you get to see my wife cry when I surprise her on our 15th wedding anniversary. :)03:37 If you'd like to grab the cool LED lights from WireCare.com we used on our trailer in this episode then go here: https://www.wirecare.com/interest/audio-visual/led/led-lighting-kits/as-rgb5mk2-5m-kit-rgb-5050-led-strip-44kyCheck out Rugged Radios which we would have used way more if not for the small engine failure!:https://www.ruggedradios.comIf you'd like your own Finnegan Speed and Marine shirt, hats or stickers then go here: www.fsmgarage.comAll proceeds will go toward fixing the damn Hemi-again! lolthanks!-Finnegan","31M52S"
