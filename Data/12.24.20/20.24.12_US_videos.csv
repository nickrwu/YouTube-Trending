This video is meant to refute these claims. I encourage everyone to watch until the end, especially if they watched the original video.In this video we hear from a statistical expert with a PhD that wrote a 19 page analysis on what the mods did wrong. I also disprove some of the claims made in the original video. All relevant information should be viewable below.Although I would have loved to attempt to refute the math myself, I suck at math and would have looked like a complete idiot. So, that's where an expert comes in.Expert's Report & Analysis - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yfLURFdDhMfrvI2cFMdYM8f_M_IRoAlM/view?usp=sharingWorld File - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfA1HVWkROlFRG4egWh0GYV5SpbJGozR/view?usp=sharingTutorial for viewing level.dat, go to https://irath96.github.io/webNBT/ , and upload the level.dat file from the folder there.

I did one where all I added was maple syrup and that was interesting although you can barely taste the maple over the powdered sugar, but what I learned from this is holy cow does corn syrup ever taste good. As an adult I've been in this mentality that corn syrup is the worst and why would you ever eat that and I tasted it for the first time in years and it was like eating caramel for the first time. I think I chugged that stuff when I was a kid and wanted candy because it's liquid candy. Anyway, what I'm saying is I recommend corn syrup.

This ‚ÄúGreat Conjunction‚Äù happens next on December 21, 2020, but this time, Jupiter and Saturn will be closer than they‚Äôve been in nearly 400 years.  December 21 also happens to be the night of the winter solstice, and the peak of the Ursid meteor shower. For most Great Conjunctions, Jupiter and Saturn are separated by about 1 degree, which is the width of two full¬†moons¬†in the sky. This year, they will be separated by just one-tenth of a degree, which is one-fifth the size of the full¬†moon. A Great Conjunction happens every 20 years, but the last time Jupiter and Saturn were this close was the year 1623.Join Lowell Observatory at 5pm MST on Monday, December 21, 2020, to celebrate the Great Conjunction with an evening of telescope viewing and commentary from Lowell's own astronomers and educators.#ChristmasStar","2H32M10S"

Instead, he becomes embroiled in the search for a killer who is terrorizing the city. Leading the hunt, L.A. Sheriff Department Sergeant Jim Baxter (Malek), impressed with Deke‚Äôs cop instincts, unofficially engages his help. But as they track the killer, Baxter is unaware that the investigation is dredging up echoes of Deke‚Äôs past, uncovering disturbing secrets that could threaten more than his case.The main cast also includes Natalie Morales (‚ÄúBattle of the Sexes‚Äù), Terry Kinney (‚ÄúMile 22,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBillions‚Äù), Chris Bauer (‚ÄúSully,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Deuce‚Äù), Joris Jarsky (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBad Blood‚Äù), Isabel Arraiza (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúPearson‚Äù) and Michael Hyatt (‚ÄúCrazy Ex-Girlfriend‚Äù).‚ÄúThe Little Things‚Äù is produced by Oscar- and Emmy-winning producer Mark Johnson (‚ÄúBreaking Bad,‚Äù ‚ÄúRain Man‚Äù) and Hancock, with Mike Drake and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers.Behind the scenes, Hancock reunited with several longtime collaborators, including Oscar-nominated director of photography John Schwartzman (‚ÄúSeabiscuit,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Founder,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Mr. Banks‚Äù), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (‚ÄúApollo 13,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Founder,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Blind Side‚Äù) editor Robert Frazen (‚ÄúThe Founder‚Äù), and costume designer Daniel Orlandi (‚ÄúThe Founder,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Blind Side‚Äù). The music is by multiple Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (‚Äú1917,‚Äù ‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Mr. Banks‚Äù).Warner Bros. Pictures presents A Gran Via Production, ‚ÄúThe Little Things‚Äù will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.

Unlike conventional airplanes, tail sitting planes rested on their tails and used engine power alone to lift off the ground before transitioning to vertical flight, and returning to land vertically once again on their tail. The configuration, although technically challenging to develop, would allow aircraft to operate without runways, fundamentally changing how and where air forces could use their aircraft. In the early 1950s French aerospace firm SNECMA (Soci√©t√© nationale d'√©tudes et de construction de moteurs d'aviation) began developing wingless test rigs to prove the viability of the tail sitting concept. At the time, American firms were also developing tail sitting prototypes of their own, But SNECMA would take it a step further by developing a tail sitting aircraft with a highly unconventional annular (cylindrical) wing. The cylindrical wing promised greater efficiency over a conventional wing by eliminating wing-tip vortices. It would also be more compact, further reducing the space needed for vertical take-off and landings. French designers also theorised that a cylindrical wing could eventually be engineered to function as a ramjet engine, propelling the aircraft to supersonic speeds.The C.450 Coleoptere was constructed in 1958, with tethered flight testing beginning in early 1959. By May, the unconventional plane had achieved its first successful unassisted hover, even reaching altitudes of 800 meters. Despite early successes during flight tests, flaws soon emerged in the aircraft‚Äôs design. The Coleoptere proved extremely difficult to pilot. An innovative pilot seat could swivel 90 degrees, but pilots still struggled to judge the aircraft‚Äôs distance from the ground while landing. Without a conventional wing to provide resistance, the Coleoptere also had a tendency to slowly spin on its axis. On July 25, 1959, the Coleoptere performed it‚Äôs 9th test flight. This time, the pilot was to transition the aircraft from vertical to horizontal flight, a challenging procedure that would mark a huge milestone for the program. The Coleoptere lifted off successfully, but during its transition, it suddenly became too inclined and slow-moving to maintain altitude. The aircraft started tumbling back to earth as the pilot struggled to regain control, barely managing to eject at the very last minute. The Coleoptere was destroyed.A second prototype of the Coleoptere would never be built. By the 1960‚Äôs it was clear that the tail sitting configuration was a dead-end. It was simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload and range, and far too difficult to pilot. It was clear that vectoring thrust, allowing the aircraft to remain horizontal, was a more practical and safer solution.

My friend has found it on the steel waste together with the german ‚ÄûWeltrekord‚Äú ratchet screwdriver. The condition of the drill was super bad. It was very corroded, had a lot of missing screws, the handle was in very bad condition and the crank was bent so much you couldn't even make a full turn. That's all said, it was the perfect item for a new restoration video.At first I thought this should be a quick and easy project, but one problem after the other became visible and it turned out to be a real challenge. There was the big dent in the left side of the case. Usually you can't bend casted parts, but with a bit of heat and careful pressure on the arbor press I was able to remove it a bit. It also worked to get rid of the warping with some heat. For the finish of the housing I wanted to have an antique cast aluminium look. I thought it would look very cool if I could tumbler these parts after sandblasting. I ended up building a huge rotary tumbler from scratch and it worked very well (video link below).Another big issue was the tool holder and the drill bit, as they were both completly rusted. Big thanks to @Hand Tool Rescue  at this point for helping me out with the dimensions on these two parts by disassembling and measuring his own hammer drill. After a bit of search on eBay I found a set of original Rawlplug drill bits. After they arrived I was able to measure the shaft and the taper of the drill to then turn a new tool holder. It all worked out very well and yes, the drill only holds with the taper ;-)Before I even started this project I just had one question in mind ‚ÄûHow am I going to replace the messed up handle cover?‚Äú. My first idea was to wrap it in nice black leather like steering wheels are made. That would definitely work, but that's something I've never done before so I was quite sceptical. Then the idea of a heat shrink tube came up. That would be a very easy solution, but heat shrink tubes don't have any structuires to it and it wouldn't quite fit the the rest of the tool. Thanks to the research of my Patreons and channel members, they have found very special heat shrink tubes that have a structure in it. I really liked it as it almost looked exactly the same like the original handle.After all it was a very intense and time consuming project.

"vk5wbpzspWE","Squishy Makeovers: Spin The Wheel | Fixing Your Squishies #25","2020-12-18T21:00:29Z","UCYAB7hh1ohA8-iX54EpMdeA","Moriah Elizabeth","24","20.24.12","[none]","2789072","140255","1366","26289","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vk5wbpzspWE/default.jpg","False","False","Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Fixing and giving makeovers to squishies is such a fun painting project, and a great creative art activity. It's been keeping me busy for years üòÇ Hopefully you like my creations this episode. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

I live in East Village in a 250 square foot studio. My rent was originally $2000 per month, but was recently reduced to $1800 per month, which is about the current market rate for a studio apartment in NYC. I told myself I‚Äôd chill out on the decor this time, so I was originally planning on keeping the place pretty minimalist and not recording an apartment makeover. But as they say.. you can lead an Ashley to an apartment, but you can‚Äôt make her resist her impulse to wallpaper every single surface. So anyways, here‚Äôs my apartment tour, complete with a small jungle worth of house plants, an abundance of vintage gold mirrors, my trusty pink armchair, and some questionable NYC storage solutions. I‚Äôm not quite sure how to describe my decor aesthetic - it‚Äôs somewhere between grandma chic, tumblr chic, and i-own-way-too-much-stuff-so-i-hid-everything-in-ikea-boxes chic.

The game lived up to its high-octane hype at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith recovered Florida's onside kick attempt with 2:09 left to end a furious charge that made a game out of what once looked like a blowout. The Gators went 75 yards on 10 plays and hit paydirt to get within striking distance on a remarkable 22-yard touchdown toss from Kyle Trask to Kyle PItts. Florida coach Dan Mullen then decided to go for two with Trask running in for the conversion. Trask finished with 408 yards, four total touchdowns and a fumble.That after Crimson Tide QB Mac Jones hit Smith for a 15-yard touchdown with 4:59 in the game to push Alabama's lead to 52-38 and put pressure on the Gators. Jones finished with 418 yards, five touchdowns and an interception.Alabama got things rolling quickly by going 70 yards on nine plays on its first drive of the game. Touchdown drives of 31 yards, 73 yards, 70 yards and 78 yards followed during a first half in which punter Charlie Scott never saw the field. #SEC #Alabama #Florida #NajeeHarris #NickSaban #KyleTrask #KylePitts #MacJones #DevontaSmith #Gators #CrimsonTide","28M23S"
