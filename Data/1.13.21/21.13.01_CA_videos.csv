Images from the riot show Brock inside the U.S. Senate chamber with white flex cuffs.Cameras weren't allowed inside the federal courthouse in Fort Worth. The Monday hearing lasted just five minutes and Brock was escorted into the courtroom by two U.S Marshals.A judge determined Brock qualified for a court-appointed defense attorney. Brock was then ordered held in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until his probable cause and detention hearing scheduled for Thursday.A mug shot, released by the grapevine police department shortly afterward Monday’s appearance, shows how brock looked at the time of the brief hearing. His hands were cuffed in front of his black t-shirt and his legs shackled around his jeans.The retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserves was identified by his ex-wife as the man photographed -- and captured on surveillance video wearing combat gear and items to potentially detain and arrest people on the senate floor during the January 6 Capitol riot.The arrest affidavit quoted Brock's ex-wife, who reportedly called the FBI National Threat Operations Center. She said, in part, I just know that when I saw this was happening I was afraid he would be there... It is such a good picture of him and I recognize his patch.There's a wealth of potential criminal offenses in addition to the 2 that they charged that would be available.Richard Roper is a former U.S Attorney for the Northern District of Texas not associated with the case and said video evidence will be key in prosecuting.It nails down the identity of the perpetrator, Roper said.According to the affidavit, filed in the District of Columbia, Brock is charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Both are federal charges.There's two charges, essentially a criminal trespass charge being in a place you’re not authorized to be, Roper said. Both of those charges, interestingly, are misdemeanor charges -- meaning punishment range would be less than one year in prison unless someone carries a dangerous weapon.Brock's defense attorney did not have any comment. But he did say after Thursday's hearing, the case will be turned over to the courts in D.C. since that is where the alleged crimes took place.FOX 4 News is a FOX-owned station serving Dallas-Fort Worth and all of North Texas.","3M"

Rainbow Blvd # 270Las Vegas, NV 89103As Bitcoin increased in price, people got scared and started buying. Now that Bitcoin is falling, this is important. I want to give my perspectives when I think it’s relevant and Bitcoin is still fresh on everybody’s mind. I hope that by watching this video you walk away with a more balanced perspective by hearing two opposite sides from someone who’s a crypto skeptic and someone who is more of a believer. Issue 1: Let’s start with the first issue that Graham Stephan has with Bitcoin  which is the danger of regulation. Can the government ban bitcoin? If it does, to what extent will the price fall and will Bitcoin become irrelevant? One of his concerns is about the government tying your digital wallet to your identity therefore allowing them to know how much money you make and how you spend it. Response: It’s actually no different than the system we have in place today. If the government really wanted to know what you were buying and how much you were making, they’d find out real quick so it’s not a big concern for me. I want the government to have a clearer policy on regulation because as soon as that happens we can finally get a clearer legal perspective and feel safer about investing. Also equity markets would finally create investments that grandpa and grandma can put in their retirement accounts.Issue 2: Tether. Now tether is not a crypto as much as it’s a “stable coin” meaning for every dollar that you buy, one Tether will be created and issued to the market. It’s a 1 for 1 that was meant to hold the value of a single dollar by attaching itself to the dollar. The problem is that technically those tethers could have been printed out of thin air, not at all backed by the dollar. What’s worse, is that when asked to be audited by a third party agency, Tether refused while admitting that only 75% of their token is backed by cash. Not good.Response: Price manipulation isn’t an argument against Bitcoin. I’ll quote Warren Buffet and say price is what you pay, but value is what you get. So while the price of Bitcoin may be outrageously high, the value of what it actually is, which is the potential future of our economic backbone, is still there - regardless of what you pay for it. It still helps all investors looking for passive income and looking to hedge their money against inflation.Issue 3: Volatility. Here Graham Stephan says that Bitcoin's price is super volatile, it can move up and down as much as 20%+ in a single day. Crypto whales are people that can influence the price of Bitcoin. Response: In 2009 when Bitcoin launched, it would move up and down by as much 90%+ per day because the market cap was tiny - in the thousands of dollars, then as it grew a little bigger, it started moving 70% per day. Now it’s a big deal when Bitcoin moves 20% per day, and at some point it will be a big deal for it to move 1% per day just like the the stock market. Stability will come with increased liquidity and volume which over time decrease volatility.Issue 4: Bitcoin is backed by nothing. At least the dollar has the backing of the US government where we can redeem it at face value anywhere in the world.Response: This is the intrinsic value problem. However, everything is based on trust. I don’t have to trust the government to give Bitcoin value and redeem it, the free and open market decided that Bitcoin has value. It was designed to be trust-less based on mathematics. I know exactly how many Bitcoins there will be 20 years from now unlike the dollar. Issue 5: People only buy it to speculate, not for the technology.Response: The CFTC classified Bitcoin as a commodity. If we compare Bitcoin to traditional investments like stocks or real estate - we’re comparing apples to oranges which isn’t fair.What We Both Agree On: Invest only what you're comfortable with losing. *None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Not S4 episode 5 was called declaration of war, and it begins with a brief flashback to Paradis island, during the time in which Reiner, Annie and Bertholt were infiltrating the walls.After the opening we see Willy Tybur preparing for his stage production, where he will be declaring war on Paradis island infront of journalists and diplomats from around the world. Unlike his usual confident self, Willy is visibly shaken in this moment. In episode 4 of the final season, commander Magath informed Willy that there was an infestation of rats in Marley, by which he meant that there are spies from Paradis island currently in the country. Moving on, Reiner comes face to face with Eren in this dimly lit cellar, and he can barely believe what he’s seeing. Eren orders Reiner to sit down and you can see that Falco is confused by their reactions. As I explained in my last review, Falco believes the two men are old friends, so Reiner’s blank expression is not exactly what he was expecting. Eren explains that the cellar they’re in is underneath a regular apartment building behind the stage. Obviously Reiner is aware of the threat, so he complies with Eren’s request to sit down, followed by an awkward silence in which Falco offers to leave. We then go back to Eren, Falco and Reiner, as the warrior finally musters up the courage, to ask Eren what he came here to do. Eren replies in epic fashion by telling Reiner he came to do the same thing that Reiner did himself, which is referring back to the attack on the walls all those years ago. Meanwhile the performance of Willy Tybur begins and along with the help of his cast and crew, he tells the story of how the eldian empire took over the world with the titans, after their ancestor Ymir gained the power all those years ago. While the performance continues, the soldier who approached the warriors tells Zeke to go to the front gate and leads Porco and Pieck to a different location. The solider leads the two warriors into a secluded property, before cutting the rope on a trap door and allowing the two to fall down a shaft.Back in the cellar, Falco begins to think about why Reiner looks so frightened and questions who exactly Mr Kruger really is. Because Eren claimed he was Reiner’s old friend, Falco realises that if they knew each other for so long, then in theory Eren could be someone from Paradis island. On stage, Willy Tybur’s performance then takes an interesting turn, as he begins to reveal the truth about the great titan war, which the Tybur family had kept a secret for over 100 years. It was revealed in the last episode, that the Tybur’s had secretly been in control of Marley since the great titan war, which is one of the things they gained by working with the king, in addition to their assured safety. Together with the Tybur’s, Fritz wanted to present a Marleyan as being responsible for ending the Eldian empire and Helos fulfilled that role. Fritz made a BINDING vow to renounce all war, which is why his successors such as Uri Reiss and Freida Reiss were unable to use the full power of the founding titan. They were always overtaken by Karl Frtiz’s ideology, and so even when titans were attacking their people, the vow renouncing war prevented them from taking real action. The attack titan manifests itself, completely destroying the cellar that Reiner and Falco were in, as well as the building full of civilians. He emerges infront of the diplomat and journalists from around the world, before crushing the stage and Willy Tybur with his bear hands. This moment was so iconic and I think it was done incredibly well, but let me know what you guys think down below.","13M24S"

Jay Inslee on Friday activated 750 Washington State National Guard members and a large number of state troopers to help protect the Capitol Campus. The National Guard will be in place for at least 48 hours. Because of proximity to the house and senate chambers and threats we’ve heard from folks to enter the building illegally and to be disruptive, the public’s not going to be allowed [in], said Chris Loftis with WSP.WSP said the response is the largest on the Capitol Campus in the state's history and it serves two purposes, for protection but also to send a message about democracy. The democratic process is important and we're going to protect it. There were some people last week here and in Washington D.C. that disrespected that process and brought violence and we're not going to allow that to happen, said Loftis.

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. “Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”.","15M56S"

President-elect Biden called on Mr Trump to tell his people to go home and eventually that was the message delivered from the White House.Washington’s Mayor ordered a curfew as members of the US National Guard were deployed to protect the city.

This comes as Congress was preparing to confirm the electoral college votes. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIviProtesters supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, causing Congress to suspend proceedings to confirm the election of Joe Biden as president.Protesters freely roamed through the Capitol complex, including the Senate chamber, where one man stood on the president of the Senate’s chair and shouted, “Trump won that election!”Several law enforcement officials said at least one person in the Capitol building had been shot, and that at least one improvised explosive device was been found on the Capitol grounds.Vice President Mike Pence, who had been presiding over the count of Electoral College votes, was rushed out of the Senate as the Capitol complex went into lockdown when Trump supporters began pouring into the building.Pence and Sen. Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “safe,” but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.“This is a coup attempt,” tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah blamed Trump for the riot.“This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,” said Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

The Senate entered into recess as it was proceeding to certify the electoral college votes for Biden, and Vice President Mike Pence reportedly was ushered out of the building by the Secret Service via underground tunnels. Video footage circulating on social media and American media showed Trump supporters breaching police lines outside of Congress and wandering through the Capitol building. TV news reports said tear gas was deployed as some protesters tried to break down the doors of the House chamber. The election certification is usually a routine and ceremonial function that is the final step after the Electoral College officially elected Biden on December 14, but the certification was contested by a few GOP members of Congress. As large crowds gathered at the Capitol building and clashed with police, President Donald Trump tweeted for them to “support Capitol police and law enforcement” and “stay peaceful.” ––––––––– LINK: https://www.voanews.com/2020-usa-votes/us-capitol-lockdown-trump-protesters-breach-congress","54S"

Well… this - the All-terrain Competition Study (ACS) - a co-developed project between Singer and British company Tuthill Porsche. Built at the request of a client who wanted an air-cooled 911 that could cope with the world’s most extreme off-road races, it pays homage to a golden era of Porsche rallying in the 1980s and to cars like the 959 Safari. It has four-wheel drive, a turbocharged flat-six, carbon panels, trick suspension and a stripped out interior, but still retains the outrageous attention to detail of all Singer’s creations. See it in action, allow Jack Rix to give you the full tour and hear from the man responsible for engineering this restomod monster – Richard Tuthill.Subscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGearWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:Top Gear Series 29: http://bit.ly/TGS29Geneva Online Motor Show: http://bit.ly/TGGMS20First Look: http://bit.ly/TG-FirstLookMORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:Want to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I’ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.","11M8S"
