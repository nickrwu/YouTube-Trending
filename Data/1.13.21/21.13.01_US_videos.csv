Images from the riot show Brock inside the U.S. Senate chamber with white flex cuffs.Cameras weren't allowed inside the federal courthouse in Fort Worth. The Monday hearing lasted just five minutes and Brock was escorted into the courtroom by two U.S Marshals.A judge determined Brock qualified for a court-appointed defense attorney. Brock was then ordered held in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until his probable cause and detention hearing scheduled for Thursday.A mug shot, released by the grapevine police department shortly afterward Monday’s appearance, shows how brock looked at the time of the brief hearing. His hands were cuffed in front of his black t-shirt and his legs shackled around his jeans.The retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserves was identified by his ex-wife as the man photographed -- and captured on surveillance video wearing combat gear and items to potentially detain and arrest people on the senate floor during the January 6 Capitol riot.The arrest affidavit quoted Brock's ex-wife, who reportedly called the FBI National Threat Operations Center. She said, in part, I just know that when I saw this was happening I was afraid he would be there... It is such a good picture of him and I recognize his patch.There's a wealth of potential criminal offenses in addition to the 2 that they charged that would be available.Richard Roper is a former U.S Attorney for the Northern District of Texas not associated with the case and said video evidence will be key in prosecuting.It nails down the identity of the perpetrator, Roper said.According to the affidavit, filed in the District of Columbia, Brock is charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Both are federal charges.There's two charges, essentially a criminal trespass charge being in a place you’re not authorized to be, Roper said. Both of those charges, interestingly, are misdemeanor charges -- meaning punishment range would be less than one year in prison unless someone carries a dangerous weapon.Brock's defense attorney did not have any comment.

Not S4 episode 5 was called declaration of war, and it begins with a brief flashback to Paradis island, during the time in which Reiner, Annie and Bertholt were infiltrating the walls.After the opening we see Willy Tybur preparing for his stage production, where he will be declaring war on Paradis island infront of journalists and diplomats from around the world. Unlike his usual confident self, Willy is visibly shaken in this moment. In episode 4 of the final season, commander Magath informed Willy that there was an infestation of rats in Marley, by which he meant that there are spies from Paradis island currently in the country. Moving on, Reiner comes face to face with Eren in this dimly lit cellar, and he can barely believe what he’s seeing. Eren orders Reiner to sit down and you can see that Falco is confused by their reactions. As I explained in my last review, Falco believes the two men are old friends, so Reiner’s blank expression is not exactly what he was expecting. Eren explains that the cellar they’re in is underneath a regular apartment building behind the stage. Obviously Reiner is aware of the threat, so he complies with Eren’s request to sit down, followed by an awkward silence in which Falco offers to leave. We then go back to Eren, Falco and Reiner, as the warrior finally musters up the courage, to ask Eren what he came here to do. Eren replies in epic fashion by telling Reiner he came to do the same thing that Reiner did himself, which is referring back to the attack on the walls all those years ago. Meanwhile the performance of Willy Tybur begins and along with the help of his cast and crew, he tells the story of how the eldian empire took over the world with the titans, after their ancestor Ymir gained the power all those years ago. While the performance continues, the soldier who approached the warriors tells Zeke to go to the front gate and leads Porco and Pieck to a different location. The solider leads the two warriors into a secluded property, before cutting the rope on a trap door and allowing the two to fall down a shaft.Back in the cellar, Falco begins to think about why Reiner looks so frightened and questions who exactly Mr Kruger really is. Because Eren claimed he was Reiner’s old friend, Falco realises that if they knew each other for so long, then in theory Eren could be someone from Paradis island. On stage, Willy Tybur’s performance then takes an interesting turn, as he begins to reveal the truth about the great titan war, which the Tybur family had kept a secret for over 100 years. It was revealed in the last episode, that the Tybur’s had secretly been in control of Marley since the great titan war, which is one of the things they gained by working with the king, in addition to their assured safety. Together with the Tybur’s, Fritz wanted to present a Marleyan as being responsible for ending the Eldian empire and Helos fulfilled that role. Fritz made a BINDING vow to renounce all war, which is why his successors such as Uri Reiss and Freida Reiss were unable to use the full power of the founding titan. They were always overtaken by Karl Frtiz’s ideology, and so even when titans were attacking their people, the vow renouncing war prevented them from taking real action. The attack titan manifests itself, completely destroying the cellar that Reiner and Falco were in, as well as the building full of civilians. He emerges infront of the diplomat and journalists from around the world, before crushing the stage and Willy Tybur with his bear hands. This moment was so iconic and I think it was done incredibly well, but let me know what you guys think down below.","13M24S"

Por su parte los de Torreón intentaron con un gran disparo de Jesús Ocejo, en los linderos del área, Corona metió los guantes y en dos tiempos se quedó con la redonda.En la parte complementaria, una vez más Acevedo hizo acto de presencia en su arco, tapó el primer disparo de Juan Escobar, el rebote le quedó a Jonathan Rodríguez quien intentó con la cabeza, el balón quedó en las manos del cancerbero, rápido salió al ataque.En esta salida, el delantero Ocejo dejó la pelota para Diego Valdés, el chileno acomodó, sacó gran disparo desde fuera del área, la pelota movió las redes y así Santos se fue al frente en el marcador.Los Guerreros se volcaron al ataque en busca de ampliar la ventaja, mientras que Cruz Azul intentó por medio de centros, el cancerbero y la defensa estuvieron atentos para evitar la paridad.Santos sacó una importante victoria en casa en el inicio del certamen, Cruz Azul no pudo darle la bienvenida a Juan Reynoso con victoria. Los Albiverdes están en el sexto lugar con 6 unidades y la Máquina se quedó sin puntos en el arranque de este certamen. Para la Jornada 2, Cruz Azul recibirá a Puebla y Santos recibirá a Tigres.","7M7S"

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. “Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”.","15M56S"

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Bobby Carter | January 8, 2021I don't recall any other artist at the Tiny Desk harmonizing their own introduction, but Philadelphia's own Jazmine Sullivan didn't waste a second, greeting us all by flexing those once-in-a-generation chops from the jump. The singer-songwriter, draped in a trench coat while her band sports all black, are nestled in the corner of a dimly lit space resembling a cabaret.We don't see or hear much from Jazmine Sullivan until she has something to get off her chest. She drops a body of work every five years or so, shakes up the world of R&B with each offering, then quietly goes back to minding her own business. Her latest project, Heaux Tales, is a bold and timely conversation piece addressing truths regarding relationships, sex, social norms, self-worth and a myriad of other topics that women graple with. Each song is masterfully connected to another through unique yet familiar testimonies by women from all walks of life.She starts her Tiny Desk (home) concert with three extended and reworked selections from Heaux Tales, squeezes in thee fan favorite from 2015's Reality Show, then invites Tiny Desk alum H.E.R. to the stage to close with Girl Like Me. Ms. Sullivan, her background vocalists and H.E.R. ate this performance up and left not a crumb on the floor.SET LISTBodies (Intro)The Other SideLost OneLet It BurnGirl Like Me (featuring H.E.R.)MUSICIANSJazmine Sullivan: vocalsH.E.R.: vocalsAlisa Joe: vocalsNatalie Curtis: vocalsAyana George: vocalsDave Watson: drumsSimon Martinez: guitarJermaine Blandford: bassEric Wortham: keysCREDITSVideo: Mansa Twin Johnson, Mignotae Kebede, Evan MorsellAudio: Chauncey BurneyCreative Director: Amaya SeguraSet Design: Matthew EnglebertExecutive Producer: Omari WilliamsTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producer: Maia SternAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle SmithExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann","19M50S"

This is a cursed minecraft mod and I think you can see why. I mean we have guns. I think that just shows how cursed it is. Also there are realistic physics like falling tree... and guns... I don't know why I'm so caught up about that. Whatever, enjoy the speedruns and you definitely will because each one of them is a world record... on a game that no one else speedruns... okay I should just stop talking.Also I'm gonna do this cause all the cool kids do:Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.

He leads the country in all three categories. Smith would be the first wideout to win the award since Michigan's Desmond Howard in 1991.

He held a rally earlier Wednesday and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, telling them to “get rid of the weak Congress people” and saying, “get the weak ones get out; this is the time for strength.”Trump supporters breached the Capitol building and clashed with law enforcement before disrupting Congress’ tallying of the Electoral College votes. Trump has repeatedly told his supporters that the November election was stolen from him, even though that is not true.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I’ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.","11M8S"

That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!Wonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man’s body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end? What exactly is the message of this movie?!To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Wonder Woman 1984!
